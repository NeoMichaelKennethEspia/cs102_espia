"TheLittleSongbird","23 November 2010","I am a huge Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki fan, and My Neighbour Totoro is no exception. In fact it is one of my favourites from them. There are so many wonderful things about My Neighbour Totoro. It is very simple in story and character but it is all very beautiful, charming and touching. The animation is typical Ghibli, ethereal-looking and just ravishing to watch, while the music is one of my favourite scores in a Ghibli film. The story is simple, but I loved the simplicity, it had such a pleasant atmosphere to it, and the characters are engaging with great chemistry together. I have very little to complain about the voice acting either, everybody did a fine job. In conclusion, in my opinion this is an animated classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"SnoopyStyle","16 October 2016","Professor Tatsuo Kusakabe moves his daughters Satsuki and Mei to an old house in the country near the hospital where his wife Yasuko is convalescencing. The girls find tiny soot sprites scurrying away from the light. Mei discovers forest spirit Totoro sleeping in a giant tree. The girls are waiting for their father at the bus stop. He's late. Mei is falling asleep when Totoro shows up. Satsuki gives him an umbrella and he's overjoyed. He gives the girls a gift of acorns as he boards the cat-bus.It's a gentle story with cute characters and an adorable spirit from legendary animator Hayao Miyazaki. The drama isn't that heightened but it's a great coming-of-age story nonetheless. Totoro discovering the fun of raindrops on the umbrella is pure joy. There is simply an endearing gentleness that extend even to the closing credits animation.","

"Galina_movie_fan","15 October 2007","I absolutely agree with Roger Ebert who called ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""One of the most beloved of all family films"". Its colorfully bright and sparkling animation is enchanting. It is incredibly realistic and at the same time makes us along with two main characters, the young sisters ready for a miracle to happen any minute. The gentle story is touching, uplifting, funny, and tender without being overly sentimental or didactic. The film takes place in the early 50s, when 10-year-old Satsuki and her baby sister, curious and energetic 4-year-old Mei spend one summer in an old house in the country side with their University professor father while their mother recovers from a serious illness in the nearby hospital. The great master Hayao Miyazaki remembers well what it is like to be a child, to see magic in the everyday life and be always ready to encounter it. This ability usually disappears as the child becomes adult but it stays forever in a few chosen, and they become the visionary Artists - just like Miyazaki himself. The film is partially autobiographical for the writer/director/storyboard artist. ""When Miyazaki and his brothers were children, his mother suffered from spinal tuberculosis for nine years, and spent much of her time hospitalized. It is implied, yet never revealed in the film, that Satsuki and Mei's mother also suffers from tuberculosis. He once said the film would have been too painful for him to make if the two protagonists were boys instead of girls."" (From the IMDb film trivia)Totoro of the title is an adorable funny blue forest spirit who lives in the nest beneath a huge tree and makes the trees grow and the winds blow. Totoro becomes the friend and protector of the sisters and one day he sends them on the bus journey that is like nothing they and the viewers could ever imagine. I wish I could ride that cat bus. What a wild and kind imagination an artist should have to create it. How much happier we all are knowing that Hayao Miyazaki exists and makes his amazing films at the Studio Ghibli for which King Totoro is the mascot.","

"planktonrules","24 June 2005","Although so many reviews have been written here for the movie, I am including one because there are now 3 different video versions of this movie and all three are certainly worth watching.Originally in the United States, 20th Century Fox released the movie on video in the early 90s. This is the version I first saw. Then, a few years later, Studio Ghibli (who made this film in Japan) signed a deal for exclusivity with Disney. This has resulted in a more widespread release of their pictures but has also recently resulted in a new dubbed version of the movie. The Disney version has, perhaps, more realistic voices--as the children sound more like kids. However, I prefer the original voices--particularly the voice for Mei. I think it's the same lady who does the voice of Angelica on Rugrats.Finally, there is the original Japanese version that is subtitled into English. I am a bit compulsive and actually have seen all three versions! I think the subtitled is best because there are also a few tiny scenes that are in neither dubbed versions (not enough to change the story, but still I prefer a complete film). Of the dubbed, my loyalty is to the Fox version--it just sounds more charming and cute.Now about the movie itself, the animation is about the best you'll find anywhere--particularly the gorgeous backgrounds. They seem to yell out ""QUALITY PRODUCTION"" throughout. The story, though very simple, is very captivating and the emotional response the film triggers is amazing. Anyone (except a total curmudgeon) will love this charming and simple film. See the movie, as it's about as good an animated film as you can find--regardless of where it was made.","

"Spectravideo","1 January 2005","There is no compulsory villain in this wonderfully animated film, no moral lessons, no standard blue print story, and the characters will definitely not break out in a song. Thank God! It's simply a great film for all ages. Don't mind if the soundtrack isn't dubbed to your native language, my kids (4 and 6 years old) could easily follow the story with just a few helpers. Japanese is a wonderful language. The film has great direction, beautiful backgrounds and a mystical, pleasant aura throughout. There's nothing like this, I promise you. It's idyllic, for the most part, but still with an exciting story that unfolds into something very unexpected.","

"ghostofdaniel","18 August 2004","My favorite Miyazaki's movie is ""Princess Mononoke"" on a graphical scale. But on a ""charming scale"", this one is really the best.Even the Disney movies are not so charming than this movie. Poetic, charming, cute, I can't find the words to describe the good this movie made to me. Miyazaki brings us into the wonderlands of the children, better than ""Alice in wonderland"" or ""Peter pan"".In fact, Miyazaki makes us loving children. In the movie, the children run, shout all time, laugh, cry, and so on. In the real world, I hate this. In normal movies I hate this too. But, here, every actions of the two little girls touch us deep in our heart. We learn to love children's world.Every one of us will have a smile on this face, from the beginning to the end of this movie.My favorite scene is the first encounter between Mei and Totoro. It's fun, poetic, and charming. Miyazaki succeeds to make a movie enjoyable for the very little kids (4 y.o.) and for the adult audience. It's very rare to succeed doing that !Really, a masterpiece !10/10 !","

"burgan6203","29 September 2004","I first saw ""My Neighbor Totoro"" when I was maybe seven.At the time, I thought that it was really boring(that was still when I liked Disney movies). Years later, when I discovered ""Princess Mononoke"" I learned that MNT was by the same director and watched it again. And I find that I appreciate this film a whole lot more now then I did when I was seven.The animation is absolutely stunning(as with all Miyazaki films)and the story is deceptively simple, told with patient, subtle attention to detail. The best example IMO is the scene where Mei falls asleep on Totoro's stomach.It's fruitless to try and describe it;you have to see it for yourself.In closing, I would just like to say that I can't wait for a decent DVD to arrive so I can view this quiet masterpiece in widescreen in Japanese with subtitles.","

"Xstal","1 November 2020","A phenomenally, enchantingly crafted piece of animation that will restore your faith in just about anything. Take a look at a world through the eyes of two young girls, Satsuki and Mei who are both desperately missing their hospitalised mother and coming to terms with it in their own unique way and, with a bit of help, from some interesting friends they find in their neighbourhood. As honest as the day is long, there's something in here for everyone if you can find a way to open your mind to it.","

"WeAreLive","4 April 2020","Two young girls, 10-year-old Satsuki and her 4-year-old sister Mei, move into a house in the country with their father to be closer to their hospitalized mother. Satsuki and Mei discover that the nearby forest is inhabited by magical creatures called Totoros (pronounced toe-toe-ro). They soon befriend these Totoros, and have several magical adventures.Like I said in the title even though I do find it a bit more childish compared to the other films I thought it was a fun watch especially with how cute totoro plus as i am quirented I have been watch quite a few studio ghibli films on Netflix. So expect reviews for those.The dub was also good, it was nice seeing Tim Daly (the voice of Superman) in an anime dub.Overall if you are looking for something for your kids to enjoy I highly recommend this film.Edit 10/11/20i saw the old dub today and it was fairly decent as well.","

"EarthwormJimFan","20 February 2005","From the brilliant ""Walt Disney of Japan"", Hayao Miyazaki, comes a wonderful soothing film that everyone will simply embrace. Featuring stunning animation, endearing personable characters, and a heart-tugging storyline that's simple, enchanting, and even dramatic.Sometimes you feel like you're not watching an animated children's movie, because the characters (particularly the children) and the storyline seem so realistic. There's no bad guy, no song numbers, and no references to pop-culture. Most cartoons (especially Disney) feature these and it gets old and routine. Here we have a break from all of that and get a real masterpiece.Miraculously, Totoro doesn't talk, and yet you can still understand what the lovable furry creature is thinking with his endearing actions. And the six-legged CatBus is undeniably one of the most imaginative characters in animation history. And the human characters are also remarkable. Mei and Satsuki act like little girls, not like kids who are smarter than adults (a routine toons today are guilty of).I loved Totoro when I was a small child and I always will. When I have children of my own someday, I will show them Totoro instead of toy commercials like Dora and Elmo's world.BOTTOM LINE: A masterpiece... pure and simple.","

"ma-cortes","6 February 2019","Fascinating and wonderful cartoon movie by the genius Hayao Miyazaki . This magnificent cartoon movie concerns Japanese legends , and forest spirits . Exciting and rather good film set in the fifities about a Japanese family moves to country , being formed by the University professor father and his children : Salsaki and her younger sister Lucy whose new house in the country is filled with magic , including strange creatures as some black dusty balls and especially by Tororo . It is a cuddly , friendly animal that can fly , if weird mix of bear , owl , cat and seal with a gentle rear and whiskers . Naturally , every time the two sisters get into mischief , the sympathetic Totoro is there to rescue then . Meanwhile their mummy recuperates from Tuberculosis in hospital and only gradually becomes aware that something's hanging in the trees outside .This wonderful film is plenty of fantasy , adventures, spectacular images and with ecological message . The picture is narrated with sensibility and sense of wonder and being quite entertaining . This is the animated movie that first brought Miyazaki international attention , it remains as a cartoon movie achievement almost without parallel. The first half delicately captures both quietness and mystery as two little girls move with their daddy to remote new mansion in the countryside , inhabited by strange spirits . While younger spectators will adore the funny creatures : Tororo , Kodamas , the twelve-legged cat-bus that can be only seen by kiddies ; adults will perhaps best appreciate the movie's delicate rending of atmosphere and its attuned understanding of the wonders and anxieties of infancy . It contains a great sestimentality and sensibility , it will be utterly refreshing to those raised on a diet of Walt Disney . The protagonist animal , house-sized Totoro steals the show , it is a giant cat-alike that can fly and has a magic bus which only can be seen by children . This stunning and superbly imagined film will appeal both , children and adults .The motion picture was splendidly realized by Hayao Miyazaki , he personally corrected or redrew more than 80,000 of the film's thousands animation cels . Being accompanied by sensitive music score composed by his usual musician , Joe Hisaishi. It packs up a big resonance , weight and delicacy that make it all an awesome film . Never remotely didactic , the movie is ultimately a children fantasy that touches brief thoughtful issues dealing with sintoism religion , ethical , ecological and kiddies psychological themes . It has some self-biographic elements as Miyazaki's mother suffered TB for 9 years , and she standed in hospital . It followed a Short movie , titled ¨Mei and the cat-bus¨ it is only exhibited in Ghibli studios . My neighbour Tororo premiered in cinemas along with ¨The tomb of glowworms ¨ (1988) by Isao Takahata and failed at boxoffice . However , later on Tororo has turned to be a real classic movie . As Tororo is an icon or brand in Ghibli Studios , getting a great merchandising . No other Word : a masterpiece
Miyazaki wasn't yet a culture hero in Japan when made this animated mythic adventure ; later on , he directed ¨Princess Monokone¨converted the first of any kind to gross over the box office in Japan and around the world , it raised him to a status approaching living national treasure . Miyazaki also directed other excellent cartoon movies as ¨Lupin¨ (1978) , Castle of Cagliostro¨ (1979) , ¨Nausica of the valley of wind¨ , ¨Howl's moving castle¨ , ¨Laputa castle of the sky¨ ,¨Porco Rosso¨ , ¨Kiki's delivery service¨, ¨Chihiro¨ or ¨Spirited away¨: the highest grossing Japanese film ever , and this cult movie : ¨My neighbour Tororo¨ .","

"DICK STEEL","10 June 2007","I have never sat through a complete Hayao Miyazaki animated movie despite all the good vibes, reviews, recommendations I got from friends. Actually I have Spirited Away on DVD just waiting to be watched, but for some reason it still sits on my desk amongst others. Well, a good friend from up north passed me THREE Miyazaki DVDs, and given I'm going to where he is tomorrow visiting someone who mentioned during a visit to the previous movie set, how the scene was reminiscent of My Neighbor Totoro, I thought I'll pop that DVD and give it a watch.I was blown away. This IS animation, with a story suitable for kids to understand, and for adults to get a kick out of given its fantastical pieces. I shan't spoil the movie by spelling out the storyline, but suffice to say it centers very simply on a family, the father a professor who has recently uprooted his family of two girls, Satsuki and Mai, to the countryside, to provide a healthier environment for their ailing mom, currently in the hospital, to recuperate in. Thus begins the children's adventures in the country, with its lush greenery, and of course, with their new found friend, a giant ghibil known as Totoro, with seemingly magical powers of flight and fantasy.And it is in its simplicity where its beauty shines through. It is always said that children can see things that adults don't, and hence, there's a constant question as to whether Totoro is real, or not, and if so, how its interactions with the kids are possible. It's not just Totoro itself which is out of this world, but I totally like that grinning cat-bus.This is the kind of animated movie that our local animation production houses should be looking at. First and foremost, the story. While it doesn't contain huge battle sequences, complex or multiple characters for the sake of stuffing the movie, it goes to show that the story matters, in its ability to touch and resonate with audiences young and old (while the young ones go to the cinemas, don't forget the adults have to bring them too, and somehow you have to entertain them as well without being too complex for the little ones to understand).The character designs are also kept simple, but nonetheless effective. The animation here is top notch despite it being 2D, as are the cast who voiced the characters. The acid test here is whether the movie can stand the test of time, and watching it close to 20 years after it was made, the answer is a resounding yes, it passed with flying colours. There are plenty of moments where you go ""so cute!"" without it being saccharine, or trying too hard, and that is indeed remarkable. Characterization is superb, especially Mai, whom I think everyone who has a kid sister, would be able to relate to. That's how realistic I thought she was!Everything in this movie works well together, like a fine orchestra performing its pieces with precision yet with lots of heart. I do feel compelled to pop in and watch all the other Hayao Miyazaki DVDs I have in my collection, but I have to travel tomorrow and be away the next few days. You can be sure however, I will be back and complete watching them all real soon!I like Tonari no Totoro, certainly one of the best movies I've seen!","

"ww_sketcher","5 April 2005","Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro is a film that should be able to put a smile on any viewers face, and without a doubt, it'll take you on one of the most whimsical and fantastic journey's ever.My Neighbor Totoro is a story that definitely something children can relate with, as i watched this with someone, they immediately paused the film and asked if this reminded me of being 4 years old again. This film really connects with people. But it's far from a quality nostalgia piece, it's well animated, beautiful, avoids cliché stereotypes (from both typical of the Anime genre and Children's Fantasy films), and is beautifully filmed (see scenes such as the girls waiting for the bus with Totoro and the scene where the magic nuts and seeds grow with the help of Totoro).Even the English dub done by Fox isn't as bad everyone states. I've seen the Japanese version, and i'd have to say it's a mixed-bag between having Mei's voice sounds a bit too bratty for the English version, or having the Father's voice sound a bit awkward and perhaps not as caring in the Japanese version. Disney is said to be releasing a re-dub in mid-to-late 2005, so perhaps that will even out the controversy.This film may not reach the heights of other Anime classics (mainly it's double bill with Grave of the Fireflies, or Miyazaki's other masterpieces Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away), however this will definitely be high on any film lovers list, and is definitely a high water mark of it's genre.A solid 9/10, This film is next to impossible to watch without it pushing a smile out of your face.","

"billf7","13 February 2005","I first watched this film in Japanese with a 12 year old translating for me and I still thought it was incredible. There are so many wonderful touches, like a tin can in the stream while the kids are fascinated by a fish, or the flying scenes (I'm convinced that Ang Lee thought of Miyazaki when he made The Hulk, just in terms of the jumping scenes) that show a curious mind at work throughout the picture. I also love the sense of magic and innocence (and the lack of violence) which pervades the movie. It is a real antidote from the Disney formula which always involves a villain being trashed at the end. This is a film about the wonder of being a child and experiencing something incredible which adults can't see but recognize nonetheless. It works for any age as well. Enjoy.","

"cosmic_quest","22 January 2004","Hands down, 'My Neighbour Totoro' is far superior to any film ever produced by Disney and that's including my personal favourites 'The Lion King' and 'Hercules'.It revolves around two young girls Satsuki (aged around eight) and Mei (aged around three) who move to a new house while also coping with their mother's illness in the resilient, sweet way young children have in dealing with problems. They then discover these furry totoro creatures only ever seen by children and through their new friends, they are able to face their fears.You can actually feel the magic when you watch this. The totoros are adorable and their haunting silence only intensifies their beauty and the two children are so innocent and captivating that you completely empathise with their delight at meeting these fabled creatures.Although I watched it a few times when I was around 12, I rediscovered this in Disney Land (Disney own the rights now) and walked from the Britain exhibit in EPCOT back to Japan to buy the cuddly Totoro toy which is now my most prized possession from that Florida holiday. At the moment, this excellent film is not on DVD in Britain for some criminal reason, I hope now that Disney own it they will release it soon enough. I would certainly reccommend it to anyone of any age.","

"jmjolnir","25 November 2003","Picture if you will, a 27 year old male, scanning through his dvd collection, trying to figure out what to watch, on a boring night at home. Suddenly, he stops at My Neighbor Totoro and smiles.  Well, that's a pretty typical happenning around the house here.Miyazaki created a true masterpiece with this film.  It has everything a person, of any age, could want.  There are points that it is hilarious, a few points where it makes one slightly nervous, the animation is outstanding (as with all Miyazaki films), and aside from lacking a little bit in plot (what movie doesn't nowadays?), the story is wonderful.One of the things that makes this film shine, at least for me, is that there is absolutely no antagonist role.  No bad guy whatsoever, and only a genius like Miyazaki could pull that off.Is this a childrens movie?  Yes, of course it is.  Is it a movie only for children?  Well...  maybe for the inner child inside all of us.  There's humour in this movie that the young will laugh at, and there's a bit of humour in the movie that only adults will fully catch and appreciate, without it being ""adult humour"".I would reccommend, and have reccommended this film to anyone that would listen.Thank you again Miyazaki Sensei.","

"kosmasp","18 June 2020","Or one for two would also be cool. Now I'm not sure what the Totoro is or was based on. But I know when it comes to imagination Studio Ghibli had an abundance of it. Which is present here too. You have to suspend disbelief and let fantasy reign. Your inner kid will thank you for it.Another reviewer says this movie restores his faith in humanity in him. There are many things one can take from watching this, but I would think this is one of the best takes anyone can get. Funny, playful, dreamy, but still coherent throughout, this really takes your mind of things. Not to mention our main characters, who have their worries, but also can rely on Totoro and others to give them some peace of their mind","

"jzappa","6 May 2009","This culturally significant Kodomo anime has become one of the most endeared of all family films without ever having been much popularized or sponsored, which is a testament to its magic. This is one of the tenderly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki, perhaps the greatest of the Japanese animators, yet his collaborator at the Ghibli Studios, Isao Takahata, who fashioned Grave of the Fireflies, may be his rival. Miyazaki has not until quite lately used computers to animate his films. They are drawn a frame at a time, the time-honored way, with the master himself providing tens of thousands of the frames.Miyazaki's films are in particular viscerally entrancing, using a watercolor look for the backgrounds and working within the unique anime tradition of characters with big round eyes and mouths that can be as minute as a fleck or as enormous as a cave. They also have an spontaneous authenticity in the way they mind minutiae.The movie tells the story of two young sisters who share a wonderful bond. As it opens, their father is driving them to their new house, near a boundless forest. Their mother, who is ill, has been moved to a hospital in this community. Now think about that. The film is about two girls, not two boys or a boy and a girl, as all American cartoon films would be. It has a resolute and loving father, in contradiction to the recent Hollywood affinity for selfish or absent fathers. Their mother is sick: Does sickness happen in American family cartoons?A neighbor boy later tells them their new house is haunted. But not haunted in the American sense, with ghosts or forbidding creations. When the girls let light into the shadow, they get just a peek of little black fuzzy dots scampering to refuge. ''Probably just dust bunnies,'' says their father, but there is an old nanny who has been employed to look after them, and she suggests that they are ''soot sprites,'' which like empty houses, and will pack up and leave when they hear laughter. Perhaps I'm reading too much in, but during this scene, I feel like I caught a brief reference to Ingmar Bergman's Through a Glass Darkly, as one sister stares transfixed at a crack in the wall.Assent to how the father composedly receives their account of arcane critters. Are sprites and totoros for real? They surely do in the minds of the girls. So do other hilarious beasts, such as the Cat Bus, which bustles through the forest on eight fast paws, its big eyes working as headlights. Instead of letting the children be scared of hauntings and the soundness of their own minds, the elders teach them to like and enjoy it all. They go along with it rather than irrationally making them feel silly.While it's not necessarily clear whether or not the adults actually consider them, not once does Miyazaki trot out the relic children's literature adage of The Adults Who Think The Child Is A Liar, So Child Is Going To Have To Save The World Without Them. This welcoming approach to accustomed Japanese spirit-creatures imparts a telling distinction between our two cultures. In America, there must always be something to fear, always a scapegoat, always something or someone to antagonize. No matter how equally violent or aggressive the history is of Japan, they do not thrive on fear factors. It is a beacon of great hope and pleasure to me that family films are the rudimentary place where cultural difference is easiest to discern in the movies.My Neighbor Totoro is made of existence, location and expedition, not on rivalry and danger. This is made crystal in the engrossingly extensive sequences involving totoros, which actually are not Japanese myth, but were indeed created by Miyazaki specifically for this movie. In these sequences, Miyazaki gets no mileage out of any trite ideas about the dark and dreadful forest. It's only nature. Is the film sometimes corny and absurd? Yes, but it knows when to be quiet and real.One of the funniest scenes I think I've ever seen on film occurs when the girls go to meet their father's bus. But the hour grows late and the woods grow dark. Without a sound, matter-of-factly, the giant totoro joins them at the bus stop, standing to one side as if it's been there the whole time. It starts to rain. The girls have umbrellas, and give one to the totoro, who is fascinated by the raindrops on the umbrella, and jumps up and down to render free a downrush of drops from the trees. Watch how coolly and constructively the scene has been handled, with the night, the forest, the lateness of the father seen as a circumstance, not an omen. The movie needs no villains. I remember that Winnie the Pooh also had no evil characters at first, but that in its new American version evil weasels have been interposed into his benevolent setting.But it would never have won its worldwide audience simply owing to its fuzzy heart. It is also full of mortal humor in the manner in which it perceives the two exceptionally authentic, realistic little girls, and I refer to their characterizations, not their physicality. It is side- splitting in the scenes involving the totoro, and in the scenes with the ridiculous Cat Bus. It is a little tearful, a little hair-raising, a little out of the blue and a little enlightening, just like life itself. The film expresses a refreshing ideology with Miyazaki later deepens and defines in his more recent films. Look at the minimal amount of external things in these girls' lives, or their father's, or the nanny's. Their story exists as a situation rather than a plot, and suggests that the uncertainty of life and the makeshifts of invention afford all the enterprising escapades one needs.","

"CuriosityKilledShawn","29 December 2015","It pains me to give it an average rating, but the fact that I wanted more of it proves that I was enjoying what we got before it came to an abrupt end. I was certain that I had accidentally hit the chapter skip button my remote, but nope, I did indeed watch the whole movie.It's summer 1955 and very cute and curious 4-year-old Mei and her sister Satsuki move out into the country with their dad while their mother is in hospital. The creaky, dusty old house that they move into appears to be hot spot for forest spirits and magical creatures. As with all Hayao Miyazaki movies there is a heavy theme of nature being beautiful and the Earth being precious but where is the story?Mei soon meets ""Totoro"" a giant cat/rabbit thing, who does...pretty much nothing. Totoro is barely IN the movie. I've seen pictures of him for years, I even carry around a Totoro satchel at work. I assumed that the movie would be filled with their wondrous discoveries, summertime adventures, and, y'know, some kind of PLOT! But nope. He's barely in it. Seriously, where is the rest of this film? I assume all those picture I saw were merely fan art and not stills from the actual film.At one point Mei runs off to find her mother but gets lost on her way to the hospital. Satsuki enlists Totoro to help her and he summons the Catbus to locate Mei and take them both to the hospital and the film ends there. That's it! My jaw was on the floor when the credits began to roll, and not in a good way.The animation is simply beautiful and is the perfect antidote to the ostentatious horror of modern CGI animated movies, the kids are cute, and Totoro (all 2 minutes he has on screen) is one of the most huggable characters ever created, but I am sorry I have to rate this on the lower rung of Miyazaki movies. There should have been more to this.","

"Jeremy Bristol","31 May 2001","This movie, set in Japan in the early fifties, is director Miyazaki's tribute to his mother (who suffered from tuberculosis, just like Satsuki and Mei's mother), his childhood home, and childhood innocence.  Although some people who watch this movie wonder where the Americans are (this is post-WWII Japan, after all) and why so little screen time is spent on the girls' mother, but that may be partly due to the dubbing.Americans: First of all, the house the girls move into is rather European in design (with doorknobs, and an attic, and a front porch) despite the Japanese style bath and occasional sliding door.  Secondly, Mei and Satsuki are really into Western fairy tales (the are brief glimpses of Japanese translations of The Three Billy Goats Gruff and other stories, along with Mei inadvertently re-enacting scenes from Alice in Wonderland and Chronicles of Narnia).  On top of that, according to Helen McCarthy and other Miyazaki experts, the name ""Totoro"" is little Mei's mispronunciation of the Japanese transliteration of the English word ""troll"" (""tororo,"" which the Japanese would pronounce like ""tololo"" because they do not distinguish between r's and l's).  This is why an accurate dubbed version is nearly impossible (like any little girl, Mei mispronounces a lot of words).The Mother: I think this movie is entirely about the mother.  Throughout, you see them subtly (almost too subtly at times) change from completely carefree to terrified with each scene involving the mother.  This parallels Satsuki's coming of age subplot (she's ten and like anyone that age she is self-conscious about believing in Santa, or in this case Totoro).  There's a little bit of both in the culturally-shocking--though completely innocent--bath scene (both girls take a bath with their father during a wind storm).Really, though, My Neighbor Totoro is less about story than it is about the imagination of children.Although the animation is a little dated and a bit jerky at times, the direction is absolutely top notch.  There is enough visual creativity to rival an average Hitchcock film (Miyazaki's a huge fan of Hitch: check out the long wait at the bus stop, which is reminiscent of North by Northwest). Highlights include a Mary Poppins-esque ride on an Oriental top, a beautifully animated storm, Mei's nap on the slowly rising and falling chest of the giant totoro, and a cat-bus complete with headlight eyes.","

"rsa5387","17 August 2008","I was initially skeptical on the quality of this one, but surprisingly this film was both engaging and beautiful from start to finish. Loosely based on Miyazakis own childhood, My Neighbor Totoro is a simplistic story with a kind of charm, depth, and broad appeal that makes it irresistible. When two girls move to a new farmhouse to be closer to their ailing mother, they have to deal with some of life's more eccentric experiences, that of impending death and incredible magic. At its heart, its about the uninhibited curiosity of childhood, and the innocence in accepting everything without question, to such an extent that magic is a very real reality. The otherworldly in this film, comes in the form of Totoro, an animal spirit who is the guardian of the forest near the girls home. Overall, this film is absolutely spectacular. Kids will love it, though some of the deeper meaning will be lost on them. Adults will also love it, as a nostalgic ride through childhood and for some of the more profound themes running throughout the film. Technically, though made in 1988, the animation in this film looks every bit as stunning today. Totoros forest and the many quiet landscape shots are absolutely gorgeous. Disney, eat your heart out. The film is paced slow, letting the film unfurl at a relaxing pace through its scant 86 minute runtime. The lethargic pace, along with Miyazakis expressive camera pans and attention to detail lend the girls discovery of their home/the forest, the famous cat bus scene, and every moment with Totoro a very 360 degree, hypnotic feel. The new English dub is well done without losing much in translation, retaining the witty and lighthearted exchanges from the original. Overall, this films serves as a great introduction into the world of Miyazaki, and remains a timeless classic in its own right. Miyazakis most lighthearted venture also remains his most introspective and grounded work. Even without the whimsicality of Spirited Away and Kikis Delivery Service, this is by far his most engaging and charming film. Essential viewing.","

"marka_dogg","15 September 2005","Like all Miyazaki films, this one is absolutely sacred. Some parts are reminiscent of Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Spirited Away (and Alice in Wonderland by extension), but Totoro stands out as probably the most unique of them all.The premise is nice and simple, which works brilliantly because the plot is established as a foundation without hindering the experience of the movie itself. The viewer is allowed unrestricted access and exploration of the messages offered by the film.In addition, Totoro is not bound by any rules of traditional storytelling. Instead, it presents occurrences that touch on a fundamental human level that is so deep and profound that it will have you feeling a range of emotions. There are so many layers to this movie, each one meaningful and special. From community building to the love of a family to sibling relationships to facing the unknown; everyone can take away something personal from this movie.Perhaps the most sacred aspect of the film, however, is that it reminds us that life is magical. Not all of us have a neighbor like Totoro, but we are all fortunate in different ways. Each of us has something to treasure, something that brings joy and comfort.Totoro is special in that it frees the viewer to be a child again and to contemplate the world through a perspective that we have perhaps forgotten. Everything is new and interesting and beautiful, from a crumbling porch to an acorn seed. We live in a magical world, and it is definitely worth taking the time to appreciate this.","

"andyajoflaherty","8 September 2020","An early Studio Ghibli effort that is charming and surreal in equal measures, the plot concernes itself with 2 young sisters in post war Japan who have to deal with the stresses of a sick parent, moving house and... soot gremlins. The film also contains bizarre forest spirits which may be rabbits... or dogs... I'm not quite sure, and a cat who is also a bus. Ahh Japan... don't ever change...","

"classicsoncall","17 November 2017","Director Hayao Miyazaki has certainly made his mark with the IMDb audience. If I'm not mistaken, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" joins four other of his films in IMDb's Top 250 movies. I've now seen them all, and probably come away from them with ""Howl's Moving Castle"" as the most appealing to me.The version of this film I saw was the Studio Ghibli/Disney rendering, and perhaps it was a by-product of that translation, but I was surprised with the pronunciation of the name 'Totoro'. It was rendered as 'Toe' tuh ro' with the emphasis on the first syllable, whereas before I knew that, I would have pronounced it 'Tuh tor' ro, with the emphasis on the second syllable. Maybe that's anglicizing it, I don't know, but it sounded a little off to me.What stood out to me were some of the concepts that came out of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"", with elements like Mei falling down a tunnel (replacing the rabbit hole), and later on with the appearance of the smiling Cheshire Cat bus. I don't know enough about Miyazaki to know whether he was influenced by the Alice story, but he did something similar in ""Howl's Moving Castle"" when the Witch of the Waste was defeated by a bucket of water, a nod to Frank Baum's ""The Wizard of Oz"". I acknowledge that it's difficult to come up with something creatively original and brand new, but those two examples suggest that Miyazaki borrowed some of his ideas from other sources.The story itself is quite charming in it's way, and the two young girls role model an ideal family relationship. What bothered me was the way the story left their mother's condition unnamed except to say that she was ill and confined to a hospital. For some reason, the idea that some form of mental illness may have been involved kept intruding while I watched the story. There was nothing overt to suggest that, but neither was there a reasonable expectation offered that she would be out of the hospital any time soon, and I kept wondering about that.What I liked most was the imagination that came up with 'soot gremlins' and the titled Totoro itself, along with those little ghost-like apparitions that followed along. Even though a haunted theme was mentioned more than once, it didn't seem to affect Satsuki and Mei, who were innocent enough not to be fearful of the unknown. That was probably the most charming aspect of the story, and if one were to ask about a recommendation to watch the film, I'd suggest following the acorns.","

"Quinoa1984","11 June 2006","That one line summary refers to, basically, what it feels like to be a kid and get delighted by a story and characters that are (to use an overused word) enchanting. In fact, this film to me represents the kind of enjoyment I had as a very young tot watching the Winnie the Pooh films. It is so in touch with the innocence and escapism of children that it actually works for the adults too. As a man already in his twenties, I was really taken aback by how adorable all of the little woodland creatures are- the ""King"" Totoro, the Cat bus, the other little creatures alongside him- and how it wasn't annoying or nearing that. This is the kind of Japanese-export that puts an entertainment like Pokemon, which is all about conflict and defeat and trying to save the end of everything from some super-chu or whatever, as the fun if shallow stuff that it is. Here is a story that works much more like a fairy tale, where there is almost no real conflicts that are impending or spelling deep trouble, only the exaggerated thoughts and occasionally distraught emotions of kids 4-10 years old. Hayao Miyazaki is really, truly in touch with these feelings that go about with kids like these.If anything might be lacking in the film it's a 'plot' or sorts, as there really isn't any- a story it does have, however loose with what goes on. It's a pure kind of feel-good story about two young girls who have moved into a new house with their father so they can be closer to their mother who's at a hospital. After finding their house might be haunted, the younger of the two Mei searches around a gigantic tree to find Totoro and his buddies, who help make things grow in nature and are generally just there to act like fuzz-balls. Aside from a bit of trouble that arises in the third act, which does hold some overall significance to the implicit message in the film, it's really got nothing on its agenda except to give the little kids a big smile and some laughs in some of the cuter, odder moments. If some American kids might not get it or latch on to it like the homegrown animation of late, it might still work for their parents probably watching it with them.And this message I mentioned- which is also connected with Winnie the Pooh on some fundamental level- is that its essential to have this kind of lively dream-life for children, to have a section of the world just for them where nothing bad or upsetting can protrude through. But, like Miyazaki's other films, this isn't a message crammed down the kids throats. It's also for me (damned if I'll say it as a guy who's usually into more mature dramas and such) one of the most charming and cute pieces of animation to ever come out of Japan, and I would give it such a recommendation that the Pooh movies meant for me- as a first movie for a little one to see and maybe get addicted to.","

"Tweekums","25 April 2008","My Neighbour Totoro is one of the most enchanting films that I've seen. As one would expect from a film made by Hayao Miyazaki the animation is beautiful and detailed and the story engrossing.The film start with a man and his two young daughters, Satsuki and Mei moving to a house in the country. When the girls explore the house they find strange creatures that look like tiny black fur balls which scurry away as soon as anybody enter the room. While Satsuki is at school Mei sees a strange little creature, about the size of a rabbit, in the garden and chases it into the forest, here she finds a similar creature which is much larger. She names them ""Totoro"", which I believe is a slight mispronunciation of the Japanese word for a troll.When here father and Satsuki find her sleeping in the woods we are left unsure whether it was real or whether Mei had dreamt it. Not long after while waiting at the bus stop in the rain Satsuki also sees Totoro as he is waiting for his bus... not just any bus though, he rides in the Cat-bus, a wonderful eight legged creature who's eyes are its headlights.This film is suitable for people of all ages, there is no antagonist and the only slight worries are when Mei gets lots while trying to walk to see her mother who is in hospital.This comment was based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles, I've only seen a little bit of it in English but what I saw gave me no cause for complaint.","

"Mr-Fusion","6 December 2014","MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO's story is about as simple and wholesome as it gets: two little girls, having just relocated to the countryside, wander off and find strange creatures in the neighboring forest. But this thing is just brimming with heart. I was going to say the little sister (Mei) in her raincoat is the cutest thing ever, but that goes for all of her scenes. And Totoro, the eponymous no-neck cat/rabbit thing, while having no dialog, burst with likable personality. The animation here is nothing short of gorgeous. Even if you don't dig the character designs of Japanese animation, those painterly landscapes, clouds and lush greenery are eye-popping.It says a lot that MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO held my 5 year-old's rapt attention from start to finish. And this isn't short-attention-span fare. One of my favorite scene was the rainy bus stop. Very little happens here, but it's a terrific bonding moment between the main characters. You'll instantly see why Totoro with a leaf on his head is the film's iconic image.The movie's just an all-around winner, not much else to say. Precocious and full of wonder, it's like a shot of warmth to the ol' ticker.9/10","

"Rectangular_businessman","12 June 2010","Miyazaki has to be one of the greatest and most creative artists and film-makers alive. Creating some of the most well crafted and unique animated features of recent years, Miyazaki makes his film very personally, checking thousands and thousands of the frames himself. To top it off most of his films are made with either very minimal use of or no use of computer animation. While I believe CG animated features are an art and respectable side-genre of animated films, there is something always refreshing about seeing hand-drawn images, especially ones as vibrant and creative as Miyazaki's. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is one of Miyazaki's earliest films as director and what he crafts here is a magical film that proves that plot is not everything. The premise of ""Totoro"" is not bad or stupid, but not the strong point of the film. However, it serves it's purpose, and Miyazaki uses his simplistic plot line to help contribute to the aura he gives his film. As with any Studio Ghibli film the visuals are astounding. The creature designs of the Totoro, his small friends, the elaborate cat bus, and even the human characters is pure magic. One thing that I absolutely love about ""My Neighbor Totoro"", which is really a very minor feature of the film, but an important one. When the young daughter tells her father that she has seen the mystical creature, Totoro, the father does not scoff at her 'fantasy' or tell her that there is no such thing as a Totoro, but instead goes along with her. It's such a breath of fresh air to see a father figure especially in a children's fantasy film believing the wild accusations of his young daughter. It's true that ""Totoro"" doesn't real involve any main conflict, but that is the beauty of it. Towards the end there is a bit of a dilemma, but not to the point where it turns into the typical structure of most kid's flicks. ""Totoro"" relies on enchanting visuals, insightful character writing and charm. So many movies are dark and depressing and while I fully stand behind depressing movies it's nice to see a movie that makes you feel good. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" not only makes you feel good, but it also leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling. If you're a parent I highly suggest you show this film to your children for two reasons. 1) I know that they'll love and 2) it's a movie for little kids that you will thoroughly enjoy as an adult as well.","

"toqtaqiya2","21 October 2010","This is a difficult film to pigeonhole. It is apparently simple, made up of the tiny, everyday events in a child's life, but unlike many films for and about children, it doesn't ignore the huge shadows those events cast in the imagination. Some critics have said that not much happens in My Neighbor Totoro, but discovering a new world, learning the cycle of nature, and facing up to the fear of death is more than enough action to sustain a film, especially in director Hayao Miyazaki's hands. The film is, of course, breathtakingly beautiful. The action may be small-scale but the vistas are incredible. Joe Hisaishi creates what may well be his greatest ever score, another miracle of seeming simplicity. In terms of story, design, animation, and music, this film achieves its aims so perfectly that it's almost absurd to give it a rating. Miyazaki set the film in the remembered landscape of his own childhood. Never sentimental, never dishonest, never preaching, and never failing to acknowledge the realities of life, he has made a film with more magic in it than any number of wizards and superheroes could create. The film became so popular that Studio Ghibli adopted Totoro as the company mascot.","

"refresh_daemon","15 November 2006","I keep watching Studio Ghibli films like this one expecting that in all the films that they've made, there's got to be one that just doesn't hold up. Well, My Neighbor Totoro isn't that one.This is a beautiful and exuberant story story about a pair of kids that move into the country with their father and meet some of the less visible residents, including some lively dustbunnies and the giant Totoro. Although this could just be a story about kids meeting the magical residents of their rural community, the story deals a lot with the relationship between the two young sisters and their parents as well.One thing that's absolutely charming about this film is the realness of the relationship between the sisters, with the younger Mei commonly copying her older sister Satsuki, getting upset and bratty and unreasonable in addition to being ridiculously cute at times, while Satsuki gets worried and dutiful. It makes some interesting observations about different family roles and I found myself surprised at how it made me re-examine my role in my family.I wouldn't say it's a remarkably deep film, but the little observations that it makes causes it to be a lot more than just simple children's entertainment. The characters are complex and multi-faceted and surprisingly real for animated images.The voice acting in English is decent, but still doesn't fully connect with the Japanese dressing. Hearing a ""Yes!"" in English just doesn't have the same sort of exuberance that the Japanese kid shouting ""Hai!"" has. But it's good enough that the dubbed soundtrack won't be distracting.All in all, I have to say this is a remarkably enjoyable film and wonderful for children and the older folks that watch with them. (As well as the child in you.) 8/10.","

"LaserBears","17 August 2007","I watched this movie when I was a kid, and while it never caught my attention as I do other commercial movies, I think it had a quiet and subtle effect on me over the years. Sometimes I think about that film, but I never knew why. So, after watching it again as an adult I realized why this movie stay within me: Totoro is a rare film that manages to capture the essence of a child's emotions and vision without being filtered through the adult's tendency to editorialize it, to insert a moral judgment, or to sugar coat it. Mei's behavior is naked, showing raw happiness as well as anger. Her movements are strong and her voice fierce, she thinks she lives in a world without limitations and not binded by adult's notion of etiquette. Satsuki is at a crossroads between adulthood and what remains of her innocence, we see her anxieties and we identify the world of the movie through her eyes. Totoro's physical characteristic is actually menacing and otherworldly, and our first impression of him (through the girls' eyes) is a natural mix of fear and amazement... the same reaction any human would have when confronting something foreign. But then something magical happens: Totoro moves and behaves just like Mei. We identify with this raw, pure energy of joy and imagination. That Studio Ghibli managed to express this idea visually, through character design, storytelling, and animation, is a rare and special accomplishment. This effect cannot be described during a script meeting with a committee of marketing execs.A typical American studio would be worried about presenting its main character as frightening, would redesign Totoro as a ""cuter"" character as a safe strategy, and would certainly make the father more of a one-dimensional, stereotypical ""adult"" character for dramatic purposes.But in this movie, we see the background story of the characters by deceptively simple closeup shot of the pebbles in the stream, or the details of the bathtub.But the most telling moment of the movie is actually early on: when the girls tried to push down the rotting wooden support of the house. At first only playing around, they then gave a serious effort to try to bring it down. But it doesn't fall. Seeing that the support stays, they simply move on. That establishes the tone and the world they inhabit: Life is unpredictable. Adults must learn to expect the worst to happen in order to deal daily with the real world. But the child has not yet fully learned this skill, so through their eyes, we see what we were, and what was important to us, long buried but not forgotten.Kids should see this movie as an alternative to the shallow mainstream entertainment. Whether they like it or not is irrelevant; its lasting impact is worth more that the toy of the month. Adults should see this movie to re-look at themselves and what they were, who they are now, and what they want to become. It doesn't preach anything, it's a simple story that you will enjoy when you can stop and have time for yourself and for the people you care about.","

"JTurner82","7 March 2006","What more can be said about MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO? Get this movie. Immediately. Without a doubt one of the best animated features ever made, Japan or otherwise, TOTORO is an outstanding original creation from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. It's about two sisters -- Satsuki and spunky little Mei -- moving with their somewhat scatterbrained but loving father to a new home in the Japanese countryside. But the place isn't just deserted; wonders galore lie within their household. Tiny, fuzzy black balls of soot (""Soot Gremlins"") scatter every nook and cranny of the walls, frightened away only by laughter. A tall, luscious camphor tree towers above the other trees in the back yard. And, lastly, the Totoros themselves, absolutely adorable little creatures who look like a cross between a raccoon, rabbit, owl, and guinea pig (a personal bias here, since I owned such a pet who reminds me so much of the Totoros here), live in this very forest, carrying acorns, making huge trees grow at night, and playing ocarinas on the branches of the trees. There is even one really BIG Totoro who sleeps under the tree, so cuddlesome and gentle that you'll swear that he's the equivalent of your pet. Of course, he doesn't just allow Mei to snuggle on his chest. He lets out thunderous roars, shake the ground by jumping with full force, grins as wide as a Cheshire cat (albeit with warmth and generosity), helps others when they're in trouble, and gives acorns wrapped in bamboo leaves in return for gifts. The story isn't all hearts and flowers, however. An emotionally charged subplot involving the sisters' ailing mother (shades of Miyazaki's personal life here) gives TOTORO a dramatic edge. This is particularly evident in the third act, when the girls receive a distressing telegram about their mother. Both Satsuki and Mei are extremely traumatized by this as any real child would be if such a situation occurred in their lifetime. What follows is a tearjerking sequence that builds to a truly happy ending. This mixture of real-life situations, emotions, and magical discoveries found in your nearest back yard make TOTORO feel authentic (even with its fantasy elements). One cannot help but find this quality in any of Miyazaki's films, this one included. MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO was not a box office success in either Japan or America, but the film has won over millions of children around the world as well as animation buffs for its gorgeous animation style; the backgrounds are lavishly detailed and imagination is galore in much of the sequences. (It was KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE that would catapult Miyazaki's animation company, Studio Ghibli, into box office success status.) The movie was originally dubbed into English by Carl Macek and his infamous company, Streamline Pictures in 1993. Believe it or not, this was one of the ""best"" dubs they've ever produced. As Disney has acquired the rights for Ghibli's movies, though, it was inevitable that they would produce their own version. This has infuriated many, but as someone who fell in love with TOTORO with the Mecak version, I have to say that this new Disney production offers charm and emotion on its own ground. The script is a fresh new translation from the original Japanese (clarifying the origin of Totoro's name), and remains faithful to the meaning of Miyazaki's screenplay, despite a few line changes here and there (nothing major, though). At first, I was a little worried about hearing Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, but both ended up captivating me from the start; personally, I think it was great for Disney to cast two actual sisters to play the young girls--it helps their chemistry come alive. The other actors, including a warm, understated Tim Daly, and delightful Lea Salonga provide similarly top quality work. My favorite performances? Pat Carroll, displaying maternal charm and whimsy as Granny (not sounding anything like her most-famous role, Ursula from THE LITTLE MERMAID), and Frank Welker, who does outstanding vocal foley for both Totoro and the Cat Bus. The OP and ED songs have the same lyrics, but are sung by a different singer (Sonya Isaacs), who may please some and annoy others. I'm sure that there will be many who will draw comparisons between the two dubs to the very bitter end, but I think it's great to have more than one adaptation of a beloved story, especially when done by folks who obviously love Miyazaki's works.As far as the long awaited 2-DVD set from Disney goes, the widescreen visual transfer is absolutely gorgeous--Miyazaki's visuals really shine with pristine clarity on the screen, and the Japanese language track features literal subtitles, too. The extras are the same-old voice talent featurette, storyboards, and trailer we saw on most of the other Disney-Ghibli DVDs, which is sparse to say the least, but better than nothing.Folks who want the old dub will obviously flock to the FOX pan & scan DVD, but personally, I'd suggest getting both the FOX and Disney releases--the former for nostalgia, the latter for a more professional sounding upgrade. Either way, however, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is far from just another kid's story. With a little bit of luck, grown-ups (and those who consider themselves too ""sophisticated"" for cartoons) will enjoy it too.","

"MrVibrating","14 May 2006","If you see a movie like 'My Little Pony', you think ""CUTE!"" and feel like puking. That's a common trait in children's movies today. Too many bright colours, boring and dumbed-down dialog, and tired and boring concepts.This usually stems from the problem that only grown-ups make movies. But this movie is also made by grown-ups. So what's so different? I think Miyazaki has very good contact with his inner child. It sounds corny, I know, but he's spot on with every line, every movement, in fact everything the wonderful two sisters do in this movie.American child heroes are usually very grown-up. They speak pretty much like an adult. They remind more of the kind of children we see all the time in horror movies(the kind who has black makeup under the eyes and says eerie things to the main character) than real children. If they're not like that, they're painfully cute and stupid. But not in this movie.The plot is wonderful as well. It's magical enough to appeal the children and serious enough to affect grown-ups. It's a rare mix. Most importantly, it's gripping. You really care for the characters, you feel happy when they're happy and you feel bad when they're in danger.In conclusion, Totoro is a really cute movie but not in the usual brain-dead way we Westerners have become used to. It's as good as Disney in its prime, and in some ways better. It's easily the best movie you can let you children watch made in the latest 20 years. Mom and Dad might want to turn off the dubbing and watch the Japanese version as well.","

"rbverhoef","16 May 2004","Most animated movies, for children and adults, have a hero or heroes and at least one great villain. With 'My Neighbor Totoro' it is different. This movie shows us a wonderful world of animation without a villain. This does not mean the movie is boring or nothing is happening. A lot is happening. There is comedy, drama and suspense but this movie does not need a villain. The only villain there probably is, is the illness the mother of Satsuki (Noriko Hidaka) and Mei (Chika Sakamoto) suffers.I can be short about the story. A father moves with his two daughters to a new home, close to his wife who is sick. The children discover spirits in the forest, not visible for adults. An adventure with the children and the spirits is what follows, with Totoro as the leading spirit.'My Neighbor Totoro' with its friendly and original story is entertaining from start to finish. Hayao Miyazaki, the great Japanese animator, has created a wonderful world with his imagination and animation. Definitely recommended.","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","23 July 2018","'My Neighbour Totoro (1988)' is just a nice film. For the most part, there's absolutely no sense of danger; it's just a story about two innocent young girls exploring their new home, their near-infectious (though very loud) laughter filling almost every scene. It's only in the final act in which some traditional conflict is introduced, but it doesn't last very long. The movie is essentially a sequence of vignettes instead of a conventional narrative. It meanders a bit, by its very nature, but it's never boring. In fact, it's rather charming. Its visuals are fantastic and its atmosphere is, for the most part, oddly calming. Its music is great, too. Of course, it isn't exactly exciting or, even, all that compelling. It's the kind of thing that's easy to watch but, perhaps, just as easy to forget.

"zorrothefox","12 January 2006","What can I say ? It's a really endearing movie, and even though it's a children's movie, I found myself captivated. The story is about two children, who move to the village with their father. They come into contact with various lovable spirits/ghosts.Before watching various Miyazaki movies, my view of Japanese animation was that it was mostly full of violent animated serials, with a smear of science fiction. Seen them one, seen them all. I know that most people love to watch these type of animations. But I've never really been a big fan of these. One exception being ""Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within"".I watched this movie, because it was directed by Hayao Miyazaki. I had already seen ""Sen to Chihiro No Kamikakushi"" and "" Neko No Ongaeshi"" (thanks to these being rated in the top 250 on IMDb) and found it to be a wonderful movie. The same applies to this movie.The animation is stunning, even though it was done in 1988. I guess that's because since the entire animation is hand drawn, it doesn't get much better than this.The story is captivating, and keeps one wondering as to what will happen. I have a 2 year old niece, and when I watched the children in this movie, I was constantly thinking of how well the director has gotten into the skin of children. Their various facial expressions, cries and antics are uncanny. Many of the scenes are just magical, and I was really amazed at the creative imagination of the director and animators. Even the title song is very hummable.After watching these movies, I have now realized that the best Japanese animation is not the type that is shown on ""Cartoon Network"".A must-watch movie for all children, and adults too!","

"zzhhhqing","23 May 2020","Can give this cruel world so much warmth. My Neighbor Totoro is like a dream in my childhood. I seem to have forgotten when I grew up. When I suddenly saw its furry body, I remembered all my extravagance. This is probably what we can comfort each other in loneliness. In any case, maturity is a disease, and the only cure for it is probably the most tender desire in the world.","

"xtian_durden","7 February 2011","Hayao Miyazaki didn't go extravagant like he did in his most critically acclaimed works such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. My Neighbor Totoro is simple but still imaginative like all his works, and it is quite simply a masterpiece. Even though Totoro doesn't seems he wanted to be lovable, even though he looks scary because of his huge eyes and large mouth, he remains to be one of the loveliest characters of Hayao Miyazaki, quiet but unforgettable, he is like a Teddy Bear. If Satsuki and Mai was amazed when they saw Totoro the first time, well I'm astonished when I saw the half-cat, half-bus creature, it is magical to see that. He didn't go far in this one, but it's the first film that I've seen from him that has a heart.","

"WolfHai","6 April 2008","The movie is from Japan and it is 20 years old -- it feels fresh as if done yesterday and there is no cultural barrier whatsoever. The drawings of the landscape are fantastic and are alone worth watching this movie: the reflection of the sun on the leaves of the trees, the reflection of the sky in the rice paddies, the high summer clouds, the flowers detailed and colorful.Two girls, maybe four and ten, move with their father into their new house in this landscape. How they discover, befriend, and master their new environment is shown in a detailed, loving, but not sentimental way. Watching these girls create their own adventures and act and react in them, is delightful. Even more, they reveal something deeply human; and the audience can rediscover its own humanness by watching and identifying with them.","

"gracegibson","4 June 2005","I first saw this movie when I was very, very young. I loved it then and I love it now. It is like a beautiful painting. The visuals are fantastic, the plot charming, and the ""totoros"" are adorable (not to mention Mei). Miyazaki has refused to follow in the footsteps of other Japanese film-makers and do those awful anime movies that are, unfortunately, popular among many of my friends. Instead, he has made animated films that look and are captivating. I love how he did the fantasy element in this movie, with the totoros flying and doing magical wonders and Satsuki and Mei looking like they're having the time of their life. My favorite part is when Satsuki and Mei sneak outside to see the totoros and they make the trees grow (and their father has no clue!). The enchanting music during that part was what made it memorable. A must-see for all little kids.","

"Horst_In_Translation","25 November 2019","""Tonari no Totoro"" or ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a Japanese animated movie from 1988, so this one is already over 30 years old and it was written and directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki for Studio Ghibli and the fact that it is one of his most known works, given his tremendous body of work, shows you how well-received it is to this day. So does the fact that this is in the imdb top250, actually top150 even, as at this point it is at 133. I can't really say anything about the voice actors and actresses here. Probably only Japanese can if at all. However, I watched the German dub anyway and I thought it was good. Just heard a really brief moment of the Japanese original because I was a little late and rewatched the first five minutes at home and I thought the dad's voice sounded a bit older than he was in the movie. But maybe that is just me.At 85 minutes approximately (including credits already), this was not a long film by any means, but that is perfectly fine because honestly, while I totally think that grown-ups should see this film and enjoy it as much as I did, this is still one of the Studio Ghibli movies that felt more for children, even very young children, than most other works from the production company. And going over 100 minutes really could have hurt the kids' attention span, actually 85 seemed too much already for the ones I watched it with. So fittingly, there were several really young people in the audience during my screening. Glad I got to see this on the big screen now and it was actually the very first time ever I watched it. Also comedy-wise, it is all so harmless and innocent in here really and it fits nicely that there are two girls at the center of the story here, one young and the other very young. So they are the human protagonists. Then there are also of course the fantastic (in the sense of fantasy) protagonists. Early on we have a bit of an introduction to the house and scenery that does not feature the title character yet, but instead shows us tiny little cute black round creatures. Also ghosts or spirits, but definitely not in a malicious way. One character described them as something along the lines of creatures where as long as you smile at them, there is nothing to worry about. But i am sure that even if you don't, there isn't. Just smile more :)Now then there is of course Totoro, who has a really deep voice when we hear him on one or two occasions. Actually there are like three Totoros you could even say, the big one at the center who is apparently Ghibli's equivalent to the Lorax as we find out he is the protector of the forest, but also the two smaller ones (the smallest one being white, but no explanation why), who are seen first by the very young character and they lead her (not entirely intentional) to the big one. But it is alright. They make friends quickly. When she followed them down there, it almost felt like Alice following the white rabbit. The sleeping moment fits as well. This was by the way also one reference that showed me how harmonic everything in this world is. When the tiny girl mentions how she met Totoro, neither her sister nor her father say something like ""oh don't be stupid it was just a dream and you dreamt of him because you saw him in the book earlier that day"" No, they completely believe her and also do not just act this way. The other girl says or writes in her diary or so that she really wants to meet Totoro too and soon it happens. By the way, you can see Totoro here on the imdb photo on the right obviously. He looks like an XXL version of a mix between cat, owl and mouse somehow. Very interesting creation.Anyway, back to what I said before, namely the scene in the rain. That was a really funny scene, actually the one when the older girls run into Totoro for the very first time. And how she really tries so hard to not look at him, although she is genuinely curious, definitely also a bit anxious, is hilariously awkward to watch. Also what follows with the umbrella and the huge amount of rain pouring down after Totoro stomps on the ground. Maybe the best scene of the movie. But there are others, also smaller less significant scenes. I think Studio Ghibli always manages so well to show authentic kids behavior. Disney does not always manage this well. Let me mention just two examples. The first moment would be right at the very start when we have the kids in the car and they mistake a mailman for a police officer and they hide although they obviously have done nothing wrong, but it is what kids do because police officers have the power to punish people. And then seeing it is a mailman, they wave at him and he waves back. very sweet beginning. The second scene would be the one when we have the small girl play outside the house and she says it is already lunch time or so and then the father says it is still pretty early for that and then there is a moment of silence and briefly the girl just shows up at the table where the father is working and brings him some flowers she collected. This felt so real. It's just very difficult to describe why. You have to watch it.For drama purposes, but nothing too serious, there is the sick mother. We don't find out what she has exactly., but she needs to stay at the hospital for a long time apparently and when she has a cold near the end, the girls are worried she might be dying. Also kids' fantasy and exaggeration, this time in a bad way. The small girl runs to the hospital then and goes missing (honestly she was such a whirlwind that I wondered why it took so long till they lost track of her) and there is another dramatic moment when they find a small sandal in the water indicating maybe she could have drowned, but of course she hasn't and she is fine and is found again and in the end the two girls take a look at their parents inside the hospital and they see everything is alright. They got there by the way with the help of their new friend Totoro actually or I should say thanks to this cat bus (you know what I mean when you see it) and it was really hilarious when we heard ""Next Stop: Little Sister"" and also afterwards ""Next Stop: Hospital"". Even if the cat bus looked so weird that it also could have been an antagonist if they had wanted it like that. Then again, the tiny girl also has a moment here and there when she looks slightly evil, even if this is not meant to be. Or when the three are having a bath together and the dad starts laughing to basically laugh the scare away, he felt so evil to me. Haha maybe just my perception.More cute kids moments and references by the way include the younger girl and how she keeps saying she is not scared and tries to act all grown-up at times, but sleeping and cuddling with her mother is a completely different story. Of course they clearly miss her. Okay I think this would be all then. Overall definitely an enjoyable watch. Visual side is as convincing as always for Studio Ghibli, nothing to criticize here. Soundtrack did not blow me away this time really, but it is still fine. I don't think this is my favorite Ghibli/Miyazaki work, but this is just because some of the other stuff they/he made is so amazing and definitely not because this one here is bad or anything. It's a good film. No hesitation for me in giving it a thumbs-up and positive recommendation. Go see it if you haven't already unless you hate anime. Still if you do, then this could be a film that breaks the spell for you to open up.","

"ladulaser","21 July 2002","Last night, I went to a rave party. Because of that, I can't sleep tonight, even as tomorrow is my birthday. So I decided to watch some anime. Tonari no Totoro had been given a very nice average score here at imdb, so I settled for it. It seems fortune itself has decided to give me this birthday present that is the pure joy of watching this movie. I mentioned in a review of another anime (Kiki's Delivery Service), that it reminded me of Astrid Lindgren's ""Pippi Longstockings"" which I was fed with as a swedish child. This movie is just about as fine! It gives me an insight of what it must've been like to be a child growing up at the countryside in the japanese 50s (which I guess is the setting for this movie), and at the same time it reminds me of what it was like for myself to grow up back when I lived in a house in the suburbs of Stockholm with a fairly large garden.I started smiling after watching this movie for about ten minutes, then I kept on smiling unto the worrying part (you will know what I mean if you have seen/will see the movie). How about that, by the way? An anime for kids that gets a 22-year old like me worried when the plot becomes saddening? Anyway, when the credits started rolling by with a beautiful, playful song in the background, I was smiling once again. This movie deserves no other grade than a 10, and that's what I'm about to give it :)Johan","

"bob the moo","3 September 2006","With their mother ill in hospital, Satsuki and Mei's father moves them to a new country house. The two girls are excited to find that their house is ""haunted"" and has soot gremlins running wild. Bundles of energy themselves, Satsukie and Mei love the space and the large forest all around them. While her father works and the older Satsuki goes to school, young Mei finds herself in the care of her neighbour ""Granny"". However going wandering alone in the grass, Mei finds another neighbour walking by  a small little spirit creature that live in the woods, just one of three ""Totoro's"" that she befriends.Having seen screenshots of this film and seeing how cool the Totoro's were I was looking forward to this film. I'd love to be a film snob and pretend that I have known Miyazaki for years, the truth is I have not and know him thanks to the success of Spirited Away. I mention this because I was hoping for the emotional depth in this film that I had with SA and this was another reason I was looking forward to the film. Sadly it was not to be all I had hoped it would have been and, although his films are generally ""critic-proof"", it was hard not to be a bit disappointed with it. Part of the reason was that it was a lot more childish than I expected it to be and it took a long time to really get going and, once it did, it was over. Although the Totoro's are the selling point, the film is really about the humans and how the girls deal with their reality. Perhaps it was the Disney version I saw, but I felt this was badly done and the emotions weren't well developed  rather they came out only in certain scenes and seemed artificial and were unengaging as a result.Visually the film is professional and polished in the ""human"" scenes but Miyazaki's imagination and style comes out with the Totoro's (which are very cool) and the cat bus (which is weirdly cool). As characters they are both very much side issues though. This is a bit annoying because of how cool they are, but it is actually distracting because of how underdeveloped the main material is. For children I imagine it will be great fun as they will love the girls and the creatures and won't find the story too simplistic. Adults will also love the charm of the creatures but many will struggle with the story that seems to be focusing on the emotions of the family but somehow fails to do it that well. Adults might also find the girls tiring as they are unbelievably cute balls of energy; personally I thought they were fun but I think they would wear me out totally if they were mine! In the Disney version the Fanning sisters do a pretty good job with the voice work. I cannot be sure if the failure of the material is Disney's fault or not but the Fannings do what they can. They are polished and cute but they cannot get consistent emotion in their characters and, when they do, it seems artificially condensed as if the writer had suddenly remembered that his characters had these worries and fears in their little hearts. The Totoros are very cute and quite funny but they are not emotional characters and I was a bit frustrated by them not contributing more to the experience than just being cool.Overall this is cute, cool and quite fun but those looking for it to even get close to the emotion and depth of Spirited Away will be disappointed. It seems to forget the heart of the story and is all too keen to just frolic with the Totoro before rushing the emotion in an unsatisfying conclusion. Fun, colourful and good for children but, aside from some moments of magic and cool creatures, many adults won't find the material to be strong enough to fully engage with.","

"Bob Pr.","11 January 2011","Miyazaki's animé films differ considerably from the usual (Disney) animated films both in art form and narrative: -- The art work in many animated films is similar to that in Mickey Mouse cartoons: outlines or features that are colored/shaded in; some movements are exaggerated for dramatic effect; almost all stories have adversaries or problems that the hero/heroine defeats near the conclusion. -- In Miyazaki's animé films, the backgrounds (landscapes, skies, interiors of homes, etc.)are beautifully, naturally rendered: e.g., weathered planks of wood have the texture and color of the real thing; clouds look very realistic. But while the actions, reactions, emotions and movements of people are very realistic, the visual, artistic rendering of people (& animals & fantasy creatures) is more cartoonish; the animals and fantasy creatures frequently move in ways not possible for people. But, while these human figures are cartoon-like, their reactions, emotions, motives, etc., are VERY realistic. Many of Miyazaki's films have a ""slice of life"" quality--there's no big conflict and climax of resolution; his films show life.Also, Miyazaki's films often mix objects (cars, phones, radios) from different time frames and some of that occurs here with telephones from the '30s, and a radio and 3 wheeled motorcycle van from the '40s. This video clip shows some of this quality: http://w w w.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi477103897/ (copy link & remove spaces between w w w to activate.)In ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" the two principle characters are sisters: Mei, 4 years old, who is sometimes too spunky and daring and her older sister, Satseki, about 8-10 years old, who cares for Mei when she's home from school. The movie opens with the 2 girls and their father moving to a home in the country which will permit them to be closer to the girls' mother who is recuperating in a hospital.The old house they move into is said to be haunted (the sisters DO see some soot sprites). In a nearby forest, they find a large, somewhat pear-shaped, friendly magical forest creature they name Totoro and two much smaller similar creatures.The movie deals with their adventures in their new home, with Satseki's school, with adventures while waiting for their mother to recover, etc.Lovely to watch. The capturing of the girls' interactions between themselves and with others is remarkably well observed and captured.","

But, I've finally seen it and must admit that it is incredibly cute. One does NOT have to be a child to enjoy this movie or any of Miyazaki's movies. The story line was good and and the characters were really touching. The totoros were so adorable that I want a plushie of one. I also loved the artwork. I finally know what some of the scenes are from in the AMVs that I've seen. I would definitely recommend this to families as well as to those who are Miyazaki fans. A definite thumbs up.

"A_Kind_Of_CineMagic","31 October 2013","I apologise to the seemingly massive fanbase for these Miyazaki films but I find them totally over praised.I cannot see what people find so amazing about them. The scripts are totally banal and unnatural with nothing that makes me feel any emotion or humour. I find the dialogue boring and idiotic to be honest.Yes the animation is what must attract people mainly I guess but is it just me or is it no better than the weird cartoons I used to watch on kids TV in the 80s like Ulysees, City of Gold or Thundercats? I just would accept it as a kid in the 80s and it is not terrible but while quirky it is neither clever nor realistic nor beautiful. I am not impressed.The stories are mostly weird. In this case again the film is weird and unengaging for me. I cannot see why people rate it so highly. The characters are uninteresting and the script is robotic. The quirky animation and story is all that I can see to attract people but I find it a big turn off. I feel it appeals to the kind of computer game playing, does not leave their bedroom type of geek who has not grown up. It is neither for children nor for adults which is my main disconnect I think. Just my opinion.","

"zh84","16 March 2007","This film is intended for small children, so Miyazaki says. I was thirty-six when I watched it. I was so charmed that I showed it again to my father, who was then seventy-seven. He was so charmed that he insisted we must show it to his grandson, who is four. I have seen more exciting films, or funnier films, but none which gave me more sheer delight. It is a great shame the world isn't really as nice as this, but when you are four, like Mei, or even eleven, like Satsuki, this is how you want it to be: everyone bigger is kind and can be trusted completely, and everything always comes right in the end. Knowing a little boy of Mei's age I can vouch for her being highly realistic, from the obsessive looking through a hole in a bucket to the scowling and sulking! The most touching moment is when Catbus' destination board changes to ""MEI"", showing Satsuki that he knows exactly where her little sister is, and that he's going to take her straight there. My only criticisms, if you can call them that, are that the DVD doesn't contain the legendary sequel ""Mei and the Kittenbus"", in which Mei meets and goes for a ride with Catbus's little son, and that I can't ride in Catbus myself. As a cat lover and occasional bus user I feel I was born to do that, and it's a disgrace he's only imaginary!","

"GiraffeDoor","16 March 2019","My problem with this movie is simple. There's just not enough conflict.I am a grown man who has never outgrown stuff made for children. I actually really like ""Masha and the Bear"" and ""Charlie and Lola"".But this movie just annoys me. The girls are happy in their new home, no one seems to be discontent or threatened, there is admittedly a sick mother but we only see her in a state of convalescence. It feels like a TV show aimed at young children right before bedtime but with the pretence of being worthy of a feature length running time.There is some stuff to like. There's some cuteness and a lot of well imagined sequences and images that feel instantly iconic (shame about the cheesy music) and I can appreciate that this movie isn't trying to be riveting story telling but something sweet, idyllic and simple.Totoru himself doesn't really do much and the climax feels really tacked-on. I thought Twilight had a tacked-on ending after not having nearly enough real conflict or high stakes but at least Twilight (in its defence) uses its climax to explore its major themes and is only the first part of a tetralogiy.Bland story, characters and themes aside, this could be the perfect movie for someone who had undergone a traumatic experience and is recovering in hospital. It's really not challenging at all except in how audaciously unchallenging it is.5 year old me might have just about enjoyed parts of this. 10 year old me would have completely dismissed this movie for its lack of antagonist or a real story.it's not a classic to enjoy with your children.","

"monkeydisco89","22 October 2010","Hayao Miyazaki is a genius. Most critics and moviegoers will second that notion. My Neighbor Totoro, one of his earlier features, is evidence of that claim. On several occasions when recommending this film to friends they have asked me, ""Well, what is the movie about?"" And, well, that is mostly hard to explain. There is no set plot, structure, nor is there much conflict; the film simply follows the lives of two little girls that meet the King of the Forest, Totoro. The film is from the perspective of a child, which, in my opinion, is the core of this film's brilliance. You can't help but watch the film without being imbued with a sense of jubilant wonder, joy, and warmth. This movie is older than I am, but still feels new and original. Everything from the music to the scenery to the dialogue is top-notch. I would recommend getting the 2005 English version with Dakota and Elle Fanning, Pat Carroll and Tim Daly, though both English dubbings are great.","

It moves along so slowly and doesn't really have any climax at all. I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters. I certainly wouldn't recommend this film to anybody.

"jboothmillard","28 July 2018","I had seen the image of one of the recognisable title creature from this Japanese anime movie several times, and I am obviously a big fan of the animations from Studio Ghibli, so I could not wait to watch it, directed by Hayao Miyazaki (The Castle of Cagliostro, Spirited Away, Ponyo). Basically set in 1958 Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe (Tim Daly) and his two daughters, Satsuki (Dakota Fanning) and Mei (Elle Fanning), have moved into an old house to be closer to the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko (Lea Salonga), is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited with by tiny creatures, small, dark, dust-like house spirits called susuwatari, until the girls and their father settle into the house, the soot spirits drift away on the wind to find another empty house. One day, Mei sees two white, rabbit-like ears in the grass, they are two spirits, they lead her through a briar patch and into the hollow of a large camphor tree. She meets and befriends a larger version of the same kind of spirit (Frank Welker), it identifies itself with a series of roars, which Mei interprets as ""Totoro"", she falls asleep atop the large creature. When Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground in a dense briar clearing, despite her attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her, telling her she must have encountered the ""keeper of the forest"", and that Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to. On a rainy night, the girls become worried when a bus they are expecting carrying Tatsuo does not arrive, Mei falls asleep, and Satsuki is able to see Totoro when he appears beside them, he is delighted to be offered an umbrella to shade him from the rain. In return, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds, then a giant bus-shaped cat appears, halting at the stop, Totoro boards it, taking the umbrella, they disappear, shortly after Tatsuo's bus arrives. The girls plant the seeds, a few days later Totoro and his miniature colleagues appears and engage in a ceremonial dance, when the girls join in, the seeds sprout, growing and combining into an enormous tree, then Totoro, his colleagues and the girls go for a ride on a magical flying top. In the morning, the tree is gone, but the seeds have indeed sprouted, it is unclear if they girls were dreaming or not. The girls find out that a planned visit to Yasuko has been postponed due to a setback in her treatment, Satsuki is disappointed and worried, while Mei is upset and angry, leading to an argument between the sisters. Mei disappears, prompting Satsuki and the neighbours to search for her, Mei is trying to walk the long distance to the hospital to bring her mother some fresh corn. In desperation, Satsuki returns to the camphor tree and pleads with Totoro to help her, he is delighted to assist, and summons the Catbus, which carries her to where Mei has stopped. Having rescued Mei, the Catbus then whisks her and Satsuki over the countryside to see Yasuko in the hospital, they perch in a tree outside, to overhear the conversation between their parents. They hear that their mother has a minor, but is otherwise fine, they secretly leave some corn on the windowsill, and return home in the Catbus. Eventually, Mei and Satsuki's mother returns home, the sisters play with each other, while Totoro and his friends watch the family from afar. Also starring The Little Mermaid's Pat Carroll as Granny, Paul Butcher as Kanta and The Simpsons' Russi Taylor as Additional Voices. This film has developed a cult following over the years, it is interesting insight into childhood innocence and experiences, it is a bit of minimal storyline, but you can enjoy the adventurous moments, furry Totoro is adorable, the 12-legged cat bus is wonderfully bizarre, and the colourful animation is of course delightful viewing, a worthwhile animated fantasy. Very good!","

"jefferythoke","3 January 2022","Like all Miyazaki films, My Neighbor Totoro has incredible background painting and animation but this art wraps around a story that is unfulfilling and builds to nothing. The films central conflict is hollow and doesn't fully present itself until the last third of the film making the first hour of setup drag as you are left unsure why you should be caring about the children central to the story, other than the fact that they are kids.Ultimately this is a delightful film with a couple of moments and many frames that could be art pieces by themselves, but as a complete package it leaves you unfulfilled and wishing for more. As a slice of life kids movie it serves as a cute story but it is not great. Worth a watch but probably not worth coming back to with any regularity.","

I suppose the main argument against this is the lack of real conflict(and without that, you don't really have a story), and the fact that the 10-year-old Satsuki(gesundheit) and the 4-year-old Mei can be rather obnoxious. Some will say that this doesn't need it; it's about the enchanting world(and it certainly is that). In addition to the magic, this does paint a convincing picture of the situation. This builds an atmosphere so effortlessly you barely believe it. The animation is smooth and ""feels"" real, including the setting of rural Japan, decades ago. There is a nice level of expression to the faces, especially the eyes. A cynic of many years, I will admit that this *did* win me over, yes, it is cute, the youngest of the 2 siblings is adorable(at times). There is some realistic kid dialog in this. The acting is great. If this does not tug at your heartstrings at least a bit, it may be time for a checkup. This is a truly well-done, sweet film that you can show children and they may love it, and it *isn't* pure garbage made with the sole intent being profit. There is nothing offensive in this. The DVD comes with a trailer for this, one for Kiki's Delivery Service and one for Howl's Moving Castle. I recommend this to any fan of fantasy. 8/10","

"morrison-dylan-fan","2 October 2019","Taking part in ICM's Japanese viewing challenge in September,I set my goal to be 31 films in 30 days. Hitting number 30,I started planning for what the big final movie would be.Having initial talked to fellow IMDber manfromplanetx about the revival screening I attended of Howl's Moving Castle, (2004-also reviewed) which led to a continuing discussion across September after Man had glimpsed at the works of Hayao Miyazaki,which led to me deciding that the 31st viewing would be me going over to my neighbour for a new Miyazaki.View on the film:Crafting what would later become the Studio Ghibli mascot in the cute King Totoro, writer/directing auteur Hayao Miyazaki invites the viewer to be a neighbour next to a atmosphere of pure joy, magicked in enchanting character designs fluidly animated, rolling up to the beaming smile of King Totoro, stepping on board the living fur ball cat bus (!),and sliding down to earth in the delicately drawn faces of Satsuki and Mei filled with wonder at Totoro, but fear over their mums stay in hospital.Bouncing deep into the woods, Miyazaki brings nature to life with a astonishing attention to detail, bringing the audience into the heavy rain the girls get caught in by dripping 1000's of individually animated rain drops on the front of the screen, and each leaf and tree branch (all done without CGI) glowing from a lush green appearance.Originally planned to just feature one girl, Hayao Miyazaki's move to instead create Mei and Satsuki pays off in splendid fashion, as the traditional story arc/dialogue of a boo-hiss baddie and slap-stick jokes is brushed aside with ease,thanks to Miyazaki treating the viewer with the chance to follow Satsuki and Mei's friendship with Totoro and exploration of the woods.Partly inspired by Miyazaki growing up with his brothers as their mum spent years in hospital suffering from spinal tuberculosis for nine years,Miyazaki draws a heart-felt passion the girls express in the love for their mother, which grows along with Miyazaki continuing to plant nature as a theme across his works, in green shoots of hope coming into Satsuki and Mei's life,from their neighbour Totoro.","

"mcongedi","19 May 2020","Few would argue against the view that Hayao Miyazaki is the greatest animator of all time. My neighbor Totoro represents the peak of his art. Discussing the plot seems pointless in reviewing this film. It is a wondrous mix of real family drama, charming and unexpected leaps into fantasy and gentle humour that appeals to all ages.The most striking aspect of the film is level of detail in each of the images: the bottle submerged in water shimmering in the light, the detail of the grain in the wood and all the other objects lovingly placed in the scenes. This kind of detail embellishes and enriches all the images. Any one of those frames can be displayed as a painting.If you have not seen it before, do yourself a favour and buy yourself a copy to own. It's the kind of movie you can watch again and again.","

Couple this with an ability to see the world through a child's eyes, and an easy and undemanding narrative leads us through a series of events of extraordinary ordinariness. It looks lovely, and leaves you with a smile on your face.","

"masonsaul","27 October 2023","My Neighbor Totoro doesn't really have a plot, or major character arcs and definitely lacks a villain, however none of this is even remotely an issue in what is a pure, heartfelt adventure that doesn't waste a single second in telling its story, including the credits. It's constantly upbeat but that doesn't mean it's lacking in emotional heft.Noriko Hidaka and Chika Sakamoto are phenomenal, they have the boundless energy of children in spades as well as that sense of childlike wonder when it comes to discovering anything new. They remain incredibly endearing throughout and any time they're sad it breaks your heart.Hayao Miyazaki's direction is flawless, the sheer imagination of everything on screen is unrivalled and the animation is gorgeous. It doesn't show its age in the same way 3-D does plus there's a timeless quality to it. Joe Hisaishi's score is full of whimsy and beauty whilst perfectly encapsulating the innocence of it all.","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","10 July 2010","Hayao Miyazaki and his company Studio Ghibli are known widely as masters of sophisticated and creative hand-drawn anime, supreme imagination and heartfelt stories. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is one of the first Miyazaki classics, ranking high in heart and animation but slightly lower on the fantasy end in comparison to his later work.Like many of his films, ""Totoro"" is set in the country. A young girl and her little sister move to a new home in the countryside with their dad while their mom is sick in the hospital. They come to believe their new home is haunted when the younger sister, Mei, discovers a forest spirit named Totoro, a large round creature resembling a bear with pointy ears and whiskers with an affinity for napping inside large trees.""Totoro"" is certainly the most child-friendly of Miyazaki's classics. There is no force for evil with the plot revolving around simple family drama. Only our curiosity at the world of forest spirits that Miyazaki withholds from us for so long in this film drives us to watch the entire thing. Sadly, this world does not blossom with imagination anywhere near the way it does in Miyazaki's later films. Totoro himself represents a source of comfort. For all intents and purposes he is merely an imaginary friend, a way for the girls to escape from reality and forget about their ill mother. A huge plus on the emotional side of things for this film, but not much good when it comes to filling our fantasy quota.The characters are some of the strongest people Miyazaki has ever created. The relationship between the two sisters holds the truth and humanity of the story. Even their father, who actually encourages their imagination instead of the expected ""parent who tells them things aren't real"" character archetype. The Disney English dubbing of the film does a terrific job in casting young Dakota Fanning and her sister Elle for the voice parts of Satsuki and Mei. Somehow in spite of their age they understand that these girls require a voice quality that it is much different from typical American children, for example. As siblings, this certainly made the connection between their characters even stronger.""Totoro"" has its classic scenes such as the one when Totoro shows up at the bus stop and Satsuki gives him her umbrella and when Mei chases some forest sprites into the woods, but the fantasy stops there. It simply is not integral to this story. ""Totoro"" is more of a country fairytale, something much different that the Disney cannon or the Wester cannon of children's stories and animation. It aims to tell a story of childhood and family with a slightly fantastical element to it rather than a wildly imaginative fantasy with family roots.~Steven CCheck out my site http://moviemusereviews.com","

"truebatmantd","11 June 2023","This movie has cute animations like most of Hayao Miyazaki's work but then again it completely lacks a plot just like most of Hayao Miyazaki's work. Somewhere along the line they spent all their budget on cute animations and had no money left to hire writers to write a plot so they decided to release a rough draft of a bunch of random animations without a plot.Sorry but all those people calling this a masterpiece are out of their mind. No one with a brain would call this a masterpiece or even a decent movie. Movies exist to tell a story and if there is no story then there is no movie. Literally NOTHING happens for 90 minutes. It felt like I watched a 90-minute long music video.Anyone with a brain will rate this movie less than 3/10 but most likely 1/10.","

"Vartiainen","9 September 2015","Sometimes, however rarely, it is possible to tell a story without an enemy, yet still have meaning, to tell something that matters. Something that changes those who hear it. Surely, all stories require conflict. Change, something happening, is conflict in and on itself, for change means that something has to go away, to die, even if it is just an idea of a moment. But conflict does not have to be an enemy.I learned that from My Neighbor Totoro.I also learned how to walk through a house yard, viewing it through the eyes of a child. I learned that tall grass can hide wondrous creatures and that it can be a pretty scary place. Overgrowing forests are a labyrinth, a place to get lost, but also to find something. Not all monsters have to be scary, even if they might look and sound like it. The spookiest grin might belong to the nicest person.Children believe in magic. For them dreaming is the same as the waking world. The older we grow the more we start to lose this truth, but as long as we're still children, we remember. If we're lucky, we realize, at some point in our lives, that dreams are important, for they are hope. And hope is the thing that allows us to step out of our doors. But often we realize this too late, if at all.Trees can grow overnight into mighty giants. And the oldest trees have power of their own. Empty houses are never truly empty. It's nice to have a roadside roof to hold the rain, though umbrellas are mighty useful as well. Laughter keeps thunder from being too scary, every old lady should be called a grandma and the reason no adult believes in trolls is because they can turn invisible.All this I learned from My Neighbor Totoro.","

"Seraphion","12 November 2015","I really like how the movie managed to be so fascinating. It's timeless considering that what it shows doesn't really get confined into a certain time period. Children's imagination will still exist as there's still children, although provided that they are well brought up. It's a very nice movie to keep a copy of, just to show your kids how to have fun outdoors and let their imagination thrive, instead of playing with the electronic gadgets and get cooped up indoors like many kids do these days. The movie doesn't show any hostility, although it shows real kids' bickering. The characters are soothing to the mind of the audience, who may just got bored of having to face shady people in real life. I am lucky to get a copy with the Japanese original voice. The voice work really is an integral part of the mood building.","

"Munster2000","16 December 2015","The animation style is what you would expect from Studio Ghibli, which I really enjoy. This movie is meant to be a sort of slice of life film, which I don't mind either. The main two characters have enjoyable personalities as well. This brings us to why the 5/10.To be plain and simple, I found the movie extremely boring. Watching a movie such as Spirited Away or Kiki's Delivery Service, you will notice that they're rather relaxing and aren't paced that fast but you knew the movie was building to something. That is one of the major reasons why I like Ghibli films and what I was expecting again with My Neighbor Totoro. Unfortunately that was not the case and I was left wondering when the movie was going to climax or what adversity the characters are going to face.I was left disappointed that the characters that i started to like during the beginning of the film never really changed or learned some sort of lesson. At the end of the day, I was left underwhelmed especially since I have heard nothing but good things about this movie from anyone who mentions it.","

"implaxible","5 February 2014","This is probably the simplest story I have ever seen in a movie, told in a way to be quite delightful. Lots of times where the silence or lack of music or dialogue lets the visuals speak for themselves. I usually prefer the soundtrack in the original language, but these voice actors were just perfect for the parts. The girls' boundless energy was infectious.This is not just a movie for young kids, although they will probably find it quite enjoyable. Adults can appreciate the youthful exuberance exhibited by the girls. There were lots of little touches that made it seem ""real"". I especially like the way they showed the odd way the boy was propelling the bicycle because he couldn't reach the pedals from the seat.","

"griffolyon12","27 July 2009","Hayao Miyazaki's films always seem to amaze me. Whether it be the dense and extremely poignant Princess Mononoke, or the beautiful and deeply affecting Spirited Away, he always manages to capture the viewer's imagination, but no other film in his catalog manages to ensnare the viewer quite like My Neighbor Totoro. In a way it is very different than many of his other films.My Neighbor Totoro is a simple film, but told in a very affecting way. It's the story of two young girls who move to the country with their father so that they can be near their ailing mother in the hospital. While at their new home the girls discover an ancient forest spirit called Totoro that can only be seen by children, and Totoro helps them to find hope within all their inner turmoil.It is safe to say that My Neighbor Totoro is quite possibly Miyazaki's most human film he has ever made. While there are many other Miyazaki films that are perhaps more breathtaking in scope and may have far more intriguing plots, My Neighbor Totoro puts all of its focus on the characters rather than the fantasy. As a matter of fact the fantasy within the film is very sparse, and appears at all the right moments to strike the perfect chord with your emotions. Though this should not lead one to believe the film doesn't have some awe-inspiring fantasy. It wouldn't be a Miyazaki film if it didn't. There are many sequences, such as the catbus scenes or the flight with Totoro that are simply magical and help solidify this film amongst the pantheon of other Studio Ghibli productions.Miyazaki makes the smart choice of telling the story through the eyes of the children rather than giving it a cynical adult spin. In doing this he draws us into this world; you literally feel as if you stepped in a time machine and went back into your childhood. The children treat the world as if it's this magical place, full of mystery and wonder. We never see the dark side of human nature within this film, cause as children we never did. What Miyazaki does show is how to enjoy life and its simplicities, but not only that he makes us remember that it's alright to feel emotion; to be scared, to laugh, to cry. As adults we very often forget these simple things, bottling everything up, making us bitter and cynical beings.Of course My Neighbor Totoro is just as gorgeous as any other Studio Ghibli production. My Neighbor Totoro features some of the finest hand-drawn animation I've ever seen. It's amazing that this was done back in the days before computers. Many of the shots are so complex to draw that most animators would shy away from doing without a computer, but not Miyazaki. Now while some fans may despise the dubbed versions of Miyazaki's films done by Disney, I've never minded them, and this is easily one of their better dubs thus far. Dakota and Elle Fanning are perfect as the two sisters. Their authentic chemistry really comes through on screen.Overall My Neighbor Totoro is a funny, heartwarming film. Miyazaki perfectly struck a chord with the audience on this one. It's an innocent look back at childhood, bringing back the sheer wonder that following a mysterious animal in the backyard could have. Though what this film truly does is make us as adults forget what we are truly missing, but as Totoro does with the girls, Miyazaki shows that there is hope in us rediscovering that innocence and simplicity once more.I give My Neighbor Totoro a beautiful 10 out of 10!","

"gavin6942","12 June 2015","When two girls move to the country to be near their ailing mother, they have adventures with the wondrous forest spirits who live nearby.At this point, I think I have seen all the major anime films, from this one to ""Spirited Away"" to ""Princess Mononoke"". And I just do not get the appeal. The stories are sort of interesting with that fantasy element that is unique to the Japanese. But the animation is pretty weak, and it seems even sillier once you add the dubbing. (Of course subtitles would fix this, but nothing can fix the silly animation.) Some day it will make sense to me maybe... then again, probably not. But I probably never have to see any anime again so long as I live, as I have now checked them all off the IMDb 250.","

"ThreeSadTigers","29 December 2007","My Neighbour Totoro is probably the film that introduced many western audiences to the work of esteemed Japanese animator/director Hayao Miyazaki and his celebrated production house Studio Ghibli. It is a film that I have fond memories of, having first discovered it as part of a mid-90's Sky Movies double (alongside my personal favourite Miyazaki film Porco Rosso) when I was around nine or ten years old. It stayed with me for many years before unavailability led me to record it off the TV sometime around 2001, where I found, much to my surprise, that the film was every bit as touching, endearing and enchanting as it had first seemed so many years before.Finally, some kind soul has decided to re-release all of the Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli productions as a collection of re-mastered DVD editions, including everything from his Lupin III instalment The Castle of Cagliostro to the more recent epic fantasy adventure, Howl's Moving Castle (2004), which, like almost everything that Miyazaki has been involved with before, offer us a series of intricate story lines, breathtaking visuals, memorable characters and a general approach to bold, imaginative, unique and utterly compelling family entertainment that will almost certainly appeal to anyone between the ages of eight and eighty (urgh, sorry for the cliché!!). My Neighbour Totoro remains, perhaps, the definitive Studio Ghibli production, with Miyazaki here perfecting the visual style that would subsequently become his trademark, as well as developing a number of thematic devices that would be further explored in later projects like Kiki's Delivery Service, Porco Rosso and Spirited Away.The story takes place in the rural Japan of the 1950's, where two young girls and their father move into an old house near the forest in an attempt to distract the girls from the absence of their mother, who is recovering from tuberculosis in a nearby convalescence home. Whilst exploring the forest, the two girls discover a family of ""forest spirits"", the biggest of which they christened Totoro (a mispronunciation of ""tororu"", the Japanese word for troll), who allows the two girls to partake in their nightly adventures. With the film, Miyazaki and his team create a depiction of the perfect summer and the power of imagination, as they use the two children to act as a representation for the audience. Mei, the younger of the two sisters, comes to represent the youngsters within the audience, as she approaches the Totoro characters with wide eyes and enthusiasm and generally accepts each of their adventures to be a continuation of her imagined child-like sense of fabrication. Satsuki, the older of the two girls, straddles the line between childhood and pre-teen adolescence. Her character is often more cynical and level-headed than her younger sister, and therefore she is the perfect representation for an adult audience who may need to put aside their own sense of scepticism when approaching a film that is so shameless magical.The story is fantastic, with Miyazaki allowing the action to unfold slowly... bringing the girls (and the audience) into the world of totoro slowly so that the introduction of the ""soot spirits"" and the mythical king of the forest doesn't seem too jarring when dropped into a film that evokes such a plausible and believable depiction of reality (as with all the films of Studio Ghibli, Totoro has an almost obsessive attention to detail, with the texture of the locations and the use of light and shadow drawing you further and further into the film as a whole). The atmosphere throughout is perfect, whilst the characters (both in design and portrayal) are excellent, with the two young girls setting the template for Miyazaki's aforementioned later films, Kiki's Delivery Service and Spirited Away, whilst the design of the mythical Totoro would become an important piece of iconography within Japanese animation (he's used as the Studio Ghibli logo, and is available in a range of plush-toy incarnations!!).As with the majority of Miyazaki's work, Totoro has deeper themes lurking beneath the surface of the story... Here, it is the idea of childhood and imagination (and really the power of imagination, which is central to all Miyazaki's work) being worn down by the approach of adolescence. It has also been seen as a metaphorical piece, with the relationship between the girls and Totoro being an imagined one in order to take their minds off the temporary loss of their mother and their concerns over her health (a factor that probably accelerates Satsuki's desire to grow up?). Whether or not you choose to interpret the story on such a level is entirely up to you, with the film working just fine as a lovely piece of family entertainment, with a warm and ultimately uplifting story being elevated by that gorgeous design/animation, the larger than life characters, and the story that manages to create fantastical characters and enchanting underworlds, without feeling the need to view them with a crass irony or an air of damaging cynicism (something that can't be said about the majority of Hollywood animation).My Neighbour Totoro is an exceptional film... one that has the power to enthral children and adults alike (another woeful cliché... but it's true!!!) with its evocative story, memorable characters and shades of hidden depth. If you've never seen a Hayao Miyazaki film before, then this is a great place to start, and is really an essential purchase alongside Porco Rosso, Kiki's Delivery Service, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle.","

"karora","23 July 2004","I took my six-year-old son to see ""My Neighbour Totoro"" at a film festival recently and about halfway through he loudly announced to the full house that ""This is a GREAT movie"". A somewhat embarrassing moment for me, but I think few of the 500-odd crowd would have disagreed.It must surely rate somewhere at the apex of the cartoonist's art. The scenes are magnificently detailed, and the action portrays real humans of the kind we all know and love, seamlessly moving into the fantastic realms that we would all _like_ to know and love.Aside from the beautiful artwork, the music supports the action all the way through, and there are several good stories woven into the movie as well.The copy I saw was subtitled in excellent English and some of the younger audience may have trouble with that, although they would probably still find the movie very enjoyable.","

"siderite","11 September 2005","I think this is a movie made especially for children. It doesn't have a lot of tension or conflict, nor does it have dangers of any kind, feelings of doom or people dying as many of the Japanese productions used us with. Long story short, two girls and their father await for the mother to come out of the hospital. Meanwhile wonderful things happen, like the friendship with a huge teddy bear like creature which seems to be a forest spirit.Saying that, I am 28 years old and I liked it a lot :), even if not so much as other Myiazaki cartoons, so it's not only for kids. It did seem a bit long for me at times, but after its 90 minutes length I felt bad that it ended so soon. If you get over the first 30 minutes, which are a bit slow paced, you will probably enjoy this animation film.","

"TheHoodOfSwords","27 May 2020","So fun fact a few months ago when I was checking this out of the library on DVD my librarian and neighbour said ""Oh Totoro! My kids love this one"" And I had to kind of laugh it off since I was going to watch it myself. I didn't end up on watching it on DVD but whatever I felt that was a fun story.Anyway, moving on to the actual review. God, this movie feels so nostalgic. I realize as I get older that I was exposed to so many films when I was a kid that were Asian. Thanks, mom. I know you probably just thought the cover looked kid like but I'm so glad I saw this as a kid. Now that I'm older watching this I feel so much nostalgia for it. I won't lie, I watched the English dub. Usually, I'm a die-hard subs only film but the dubbing for Ghibli is always done pretty well. The chemistry between the fanning sisters is pretty well and you really get the feeling that they're truly close with each other. There are quite a things left unexplained but I still feel that as this is one of Ghibli's first films and so I give it a bit of leeway. The world-building in this makes me miss my old home where I lived on a tiny island which had a lot of forests. My headcanon for this film is that while everyone in the film is pretty spiritual that Totoro and all the other spirits are kind of like a Derry situation. Where once you're not a kid anymore you start to forget. Still, if you like animated films or films that are for kids but have some value for everyone I encourage you to check this out or rewatch it.","

"esbenpe","9 March 2007","After seeing both Chihiro (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004), I instantly became a Miyazaki fan. I am especially fascinated by the mix of western and non-western mythological worlds, in which the different characters are developed. As a fan, it is IMO a must to see all of his films.My Neighbor Totoro (1988) is one of his most beautiful and charming works, and I recommend this particular piece to first-time Miyazaki-viewers as an introduction to one of the greatest storytellers in the history of cinema.While this story is simple and not as wildly imaginative as some of Miyazaki's recent works, the storyline has a slightly more emotional touch.The story is about two sisters who are moving to the country side with their father  the mother being permanently in the hospital. The story takes off, when the youngest girl unintentionally falls down into a deep ravine and finds the protector of the forest - Totoro. Together with this wonderfully, flighty and friendly forest creature, the children experience one of the most fantastical journeys, physical as well mental.If you have watched Miyazaki's latest productions you will know that his universe - social deliberated, humorous and ecological - appeals to children and adults alike. This is also most certainly the case with My Neighbor Totoro.I give this movie 9/10, as it is one of the best family films ever made.","

"zeekwunlau","26 March 2020","No struggle, no clamor, no intrigue, only peace of mind, innocence.
It is a fairy tale. It writes a beautiful and warm rural tranquility. There is no cruel fear of reality.
It is one of Miyazaki's successful masterpieces, and it is also one of the few anime movie legend.
The film does not need gorgeous and bright lines. The simple and innocent picture presentation can attract attractive vision. It drives the strings in our hearts. It has a strong and strong fan group.
Although it was born in the Japanese anime film market in 1988, it can stand still in the film industry. This is My Neighbor Totoro, a fascinating childlike and innocent realization.","

"teenage_queen19","14 May 2005","After watching this film i was so overwhelmed by happiness and i just marvelled at the cuteness of it all. Totoro is beautifully drawn timeless touching, adorable film which will just enlighten you, regardless of age. I've seen this movie around, say, 8 times? I've watched it every year since i was 4 and it's the kind of movie that just puts this massive smile on your face.The protagonists are sisters Satsuki and Mei. They have just moved from the city with their father into the countryside while he writes a book and their mother is suffering from an unknown disease in a hospital nearby. The girls explore the surrounding wilderness and have an encounter with Totoro, a cuddly, cute, fat, imaginary forest 'spirit'. Totoro can only be seen by the girls and even then, only occasionally. The movie does not have an ongoing perpetual plot but it doesn't need to. Its an endearing story about a few months in the life of two young sisters. There is no clear villain the the film. The dad is not an uncaring workaholic, the mean kid next door isn't really that bad, and the somewhat scary old neighbor is kind and wise. Everyone has their good and bad points and Hayao miyazaki does a great job of showing them.Though the movie is about the imagination of little kids, it has this incredible sense of reality. The little 4 year old is cute but loud and demanding like all young children. Satsuki, the elder sister, is protective over her little sister and a bit bossy. There is a scene of a boy playing with a toy trying to avoid a chore. Despite the fact that it is such a calm movie, when a crisis occurs, you're at the edge of the seat, worrying, because the movie, unlike most animated films, it luckily lacks that element of ""There's Always going to be a Happy Ending"" The drawing is great. Its so natural and there are these scenes of wonderful sereneness. It's just so pleasant to watch. I just hate kids, but every single time after watching this movie, I just feel like hugging every little girl I see. I think it is impossible for anyone not to like Totoro because it is just this incredible masterpiece that erases any doubt in mankind. I can't come close to putting the wonders of this movie in words, and all i have to say is watch it!","

At least it's only 90 minutes long. It looks like a Sunday morning animated tv show that cliffhanger you to the episode of the next week.. in this case an episode that you cannot (luckily) see.","

"ldavis-2","2 August 2002","""Totoro"" is not like American toons. It takes its time and there are huge gaps when nothing happens. But if you hang in there, you and your munchin will be rewarded with a sweet, smart movie about the meaning of life and the innate need for family and friends. I was impressed at how dead-on the dynamics of sibling relationships were portrayed, especially in light of what the girls are dealing with. Indeed, the girls the kind of well-rounded characters you simply don't find in American cartoons. My 5 year old, a die-hard MIB nut who was convinced that he would hate it, was captivated from start to finish. If that's not reason enough to get it, then I don't know what is.","

It proves that experience can be gained from non threatening situations, and that learning can occur while preserving innocence. It's a welcome break from Western approaches to the genre, avoiding any gloom whatsoever in favor of playful wisdom.","

"Ltufano23","1 November 2023","Studio Ghibli was a staple of my childhood as I have so many fond memories of watching those films on Cartoon Network as a child. My Neighbor Totoro was one that always alluded me and I was never able to catch it until now. The beauty of the art is needless to say and half the enjoyment comes from the childishly innocent feeling that the visuals supply you with. The acting is always stellar and the Fanning sisters work so well off of each other, putting the sisterly relationship straight into their characters. Some parts felt a bit slower than the rest, but the story used even the slow moments to showcase breathtaking scenery. I feel I may have enjoyed this a bit more if I had viewed it years ago, when I had seen the rest, but this is still a touching, heartwarming film regardless.","

"patryk-czekaj","5 June 2012","This is definitely one of those astonishingly high-spirited movies that you can simply sit back and enjoy, mainly due to the heart-warming tale and beautiful animations. Hayao Miyazaki did an amazing job, delivering one of the prettiest pictures that any kid or grown-up can love right from the start. One might even say that it is better than classic Disney pictures.It doesn't provide a strong and elaborate storyline, like Princess Mononoke or Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, and doesn't imply any moral guidance or specific messages. And that's a very good sign, noting that the movie is supposed to bring out all the positive emotions in the viewer through its magical aura and all those enormously joyful characters and creatures appearing on-screen.Looking at the two young girls, Mei and Satsuki, jumping freely and laughing about no particular things made me want to be a child again. Miyazaki is able to move our minds and make us see that childhood is the most fantastic time of our lives, and being able to use the full potential of one's imagination should be glorified.Even though it has an element of sadness, with the girls' mom staying in the hospital, it is so neatly placed in the storyline that it doesn't spoil the tremendous fun of watching My Neighbor Totoro. It's simply an idyllic tale, accompanied by a taste of magic and fantasy. Tell me, who won't be able to adore those fluffy Totoros and their marvelous abilities? Every time they appeared I wanted them to stay a little longer and mesmerize me with their sparkling glow of glee.The English dubbing is very decent, the voices were chosen appropriately so that they would seem like they were taken straight out of the Japanese version.All in all, I must say that My Neighbor Totoro really tickled my dreams of being a child all over again with its hypnotizing beauty. It was able to show me yet again that the fantastic world of Japanese anime genre has so many wonderful pictures to offer. And if you really want to start your adventure with Miyazaki, I bet that watching this picture will be the best possible way to do so.","

"Leofwine_draca","27 June 2013","I'm not the world's biggest animation fan, but I always make a point of watching Studio Ghibli movies whenever they're on; something about the creativity of such films appeals and reawakens the child in me. MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is my latest watch from the studio, and while it's not my favourite, it does have plenty to recommend it.First off, this is a kid's film through and through, like the later PONYO (one of my all-time favourites). Don't go in expecting another GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES, because this is all about magical childhood experiences and a break from the real world, a bit like THE SNOWMAN. Adult themes do intrude on the plot - the mother's illness, for instance - but for the most part this is a simple, straightforward children's adventure film.However, the film works due to the level of creativity present in the story, and particularly in the two creations thought up for the movie: there's the troll-like Totoro of the title, an intriguing and odd creature, and then there's the crowd-pleasing and lovable Catbus, the highlight of the whole thing.There's not a great deal of plot or incident, but there's some fine scenes involving kids lost in the forest or flying through the air, and some nicely-judged character work, particularly in the form of the ultra-shy neighbour's child. MY NEIGHBOUR TOTORO might not be the best that Ghibli has to offer, but it's no disappointment.","

"native_girl333","6 April 2007","""Tonari no Totoro"" continues the glorious path of Hayao Miyazaki's animation features. ""Totoro"" is Studio Ghibli's oldest production and it was just released on DVD in Finland for the first time.I have always been a huge fan of Japanese animation. When I was a child my favorite animation feature told the story of a little orphan girl named Candy. The music in Miyazaki's pictures reminds me of Candy. Music plays an enormous role in Miyazaki's cartoons. It is very emotional and touching.In Finland there is always dubbed version but I always watch animations in their original language. Then a movie feels more authentic and real.In ""Totoro"" the plot is very simple but it emphasizes the importance of family. The relationship between the sisters Satsumi and Mei is so strong. Another interesting thing in Miyazaki's stories is that you never know what kind of creatures there is going to be this time. Totoro's character brings a little magic to the ordinary life.The movie can be recommended to all ages!","

"backup-50362","22 January 2023","Like all Studio Ghibli animations, it gets weird and even freaky quite fast, but also super heartwarming.It's an unusual movie in other ways too, though. Most generic movies (even kids movies) follow the usual introduction-obstacle-fight-make-up-resolution plot steps, but this does not.There's really not a long-term challenge to overcome, or a goal the main characters are aiming towards.It's just kids living with their hard-working dad playfully exploring the world and stumbling upon some weird, weird things. We have the usual ""forest spirits"" concept, some really freaky and nonsensical, supernatural beings showing up for our kids to wonder about and try to befriend...It's just good fun. And, again - as with any Studio Ghibli animation - it still holds up greatly today. Kids or adults - anyone can probably enjoy this. Way more so than modern kids movies, and modern adult movies.Because it's just different. Like I said, nowhere near as formulaic and predictable.","

"Zoopansick","21 May 2006","This is supposedly one of the ""Great Movies"" according to Roger Ebert...My tone in the previous sentence should suffice for my review, but I feel like more needs to be said. My Neighbor Totoro isn't offensive, obnoxious, disturbing, annoying, or irritating in any way. And as Ebert continually points out in his review, it doesn't fall in line with a lot of clichés that are prevalent in American cartoons in terms of characterization or plot-line. This may all be true; but it doesn't make up for it's fatal flaw...it's boring. It's really really, boring. There is hardly any plot other then these 2 girls hanging around their house out in the country side. The title character makes his first appearance 30 minutes in, and only a couple of times after that. He doesn't do much either. In his debut scene he sleeps and yawns...how appropriate. Later he does some other stuff but it's not too exciting and perhaps only mildly so compared to the doldrum of the girls lives. I wasn't ""enchanted"", the world didn't seem that magical to me, and with the lack of any compelling plot I couldn't help but once again become baffled by the godly praise for this movie. The animation is OK but don't see why Miyazaki's work is considered to be THAT much better then everyone else's. Perhaps you have to be an anime aficionado to understand why. Perhaps you have to be an anime aficionado to love this movie. I can think of no other reason why. Granted, I'm 23 and cartoons don't hold the same appeal as they did 15 years ago. But that being said, I can't see myself even sitting through this 15 years ago. And as an adult, it doesn't seem to hold much value. There is no plot, the writing is forgettable, and I don't find it's artistic value to be any higher then that of any other anime. Bottom line, if you are an anime fan, you aren't even reading this because you own My Neighboro Totoro on DVD and are probably waiting for the special edition. However, if you are checking up on one of the ""Great Movies"" or if you a parent and want to show your kid something, I can't recommend it to you on either level.","

"Jens-ar","21 June 2008","Two little girls, Satsuki and Mei, moves into an old house in the Japanese country with their father. Their sick mother is at the hospital. The two kids meet the gentle and flute playing Totoro, a hybrid between a gigantic rodent and a bear. The movie's style is quite different from most Western animations, and only a few Disney movies can hold their own to Tonari no Totoro's amazing and poetic expression. The bus stop scene is brilliant, and so are many other similar scenes where only few words are spoken. Disney animations are often too restless to create an atmosphere like this. Pardoxically the two children are a bit stereotypical at times, but in the end of the movie they become more complex. At this point in the film a cryptic message from the mother's hospital, makes the children suspect that their mother has died. After an intense drama they are being flown to the hospital in Totoro's bizarre cat bus. But it turns out that the mother has only had a cold and that she's going to comeback to them soon. This is, though a foundation for a happy ending, a bit of an anticlimax. I couldn't help but wonder if the movie would be better if the mother was dead from the start of the film. Not that I'm a sadist, but as it is, the children are living a great life in a beautiful place, and when their mother comes back, all is practically well, this would make it seem so perfect, that you don't feel like you have to pity the kids, which makes their attempt in finding comfort in their friendship with Totoro less touching than it could be. If the mother was dead, the movie would probably touch some deeper feelings. But this is only a thought. However, a psychological interpretation could be that the mother really is dying, and Totoro only is a delusion made by the children in their grief. But this would however be too cruel. Perhaps the perfectly happy ending is the best way to end the film, though a sad future awaits the children when they get too old to see Totoro. Though I'm not a big fan of the manga style I must admit that it's masterfully animated, and the imaginative pictures make the movie seem like a beautiful dream.","

"andrewburgereviews","12 November 2020","There is really no true evil in Hayao Miyazaki's ""My Neighbor Totoro"". This is a movie made out of pure love for the art form. Miyazaki is a parent to these ideas, painting each frame by hand. His is a love understood only by him, deep personal thoughts and appreciations exteriorized in everything we see, hear and feel in this movie.When two girls, Satsuki and Mei move to the countryside with their father, Tatsuo to be close to their ailing mother, Yasuko which is in the hospital, they pass by a river. The two girls look down on how the water flows and there was a bottle--so detailed--just sitting there. This is just one of many less obvious details that Miyazaki carefully planted in his visual landscape. But he never draws attention upon any of them. Often times, the beauty of Eastern Cinema is in its ability to slow down, to take its time focusing on one frame, and really, asking the viewer to stay awhile and think what he just saw up to a certain point. It is also a moment of respect, reflection, and inner peace.A particular scene for which I thanked Miyazaki out loud while I was watching this alone, was when the two girls were waiting at a remote bus station for their father to arrive from work in Tokyo. It was already dark, and it was starting to rain. The mystical Totoro and his minions came and waited at the bus station alongside the two girls as well. But not for a moment was it scary. The amount of warmth these characters evoke through their design instead created a moment of serenity and peace. So many times, Western movies tend to excite, shock, instigate in order to function--and often they do it well, don't get me wrong--here, through its modesty, this static scene, in which only the rain was moving evoked an almost guilty feeling of coziness, comfort, peace and safety.Only when I felt like I owed Miyazaki for the complacent state in which that scene brought me I realized why I love this movie so much. Because it's focus is almost therapeutic--it brought back an inner peace and stability that we didn't even realized we need, no, we deserve in a world whose pace is getting more and more hectic. But ""My Neighbor Totoro"" takes place in an idealistic world we all aspire to reach. The father is very responsible, present, patient, understanding, an exemplary paragon, and a model which is annoyingly ignored in artistic representations around the world. Only when I saw this movie did I realize how much I miss art whose path to greatness is defined not by complexity, bluntness or moral dilemmas, but by targeting our deepest, most fervent wishes.Take the ending, for instance, in which an expected tragedy does, actually, not occur and it's quickly disarmed. How often do we long for moments in which we were children and we imagined banal issues as life-altering problems, worrying in our lack of knowledge about the world around us just what on Earth will we do only for our father--a hero--to appear and seamlessly ease our burden. For those of you who've seen the movie, you know what that potential tragedy is.Remember when our biggest problems in life came and went in half a day? When our imagination crafted an uncounted number of ""totoros"" for us to sleep on their bellies and not worry about betrayal or distrust? When no matter how big your fear was, yelling and turning the lights on would destroy all the darkness in the world? And when the world was full of opportunity? I hope you do, because Hayao Miyazaki wants to convince you it still is and that your best days are not necessarily behind you.","

The beginning of this movie is probably only a 7/10, it was a good character introduction but it isn't really anything special. The ending is so good though. If this entire movie was the quality of the ending, I would have this in my top 10 animated films. This film's animation is incredible. I think the character designs are pretty good, and the backgrounds are REALLY good.

Unfortunately, I don't share their enthusiasm.'My Neighbor Totoro' has a very simple premise. So simple, in fact, that I don't understand the reason behind the film. The film played like a pointless, overlong cartoon, which did absolutely nothing for my senses. I generally enjoy anime films, but this is definitely aimed at a younger demographic. I did not get - or maybe not understood - the deeper meaning of the film. It is a very slow film with not much happening - not that matters, anyway. The film also suffers from a number of inconsistencies.","

"brainofj72","26 January 2006","In my mind, there are only two films that truly capture the essence of a child's imagination. One is Danny Boyle's vividly beautiful Millions, and the other is Hayao Miyazaki's sweet, tender, and utterly gorgeous My Neighbor Totoro.The story is of two young girls who move to the Japanese countryside with their father while their mother is being treated in the hospital. After settling in, these two children discover that where they live is anything but ordinary. They find a hidden path into the forest, and soon meet Totoro, a giant, furry, and lovable creature.The film is told strictly from the point of view of these two children. What adults may see as harmless and silly, the children see as amazing and very much real. When the children go on about how they can see ""Soot Gremlins"" and ""Totoro"", the adults simply say that they saw them when they were children as well.This formula is certainly one we've seen before, but thanks to the genius of Hayao Miyazaki, My Neighbor Totoro takes on a feeling of unbridled imagination never before seen on celluloid. The world he creates is an intimate yet expansive one. The fact that this is one of Miyazaki's most beautifully animated features certainly doesn't hurt this. Everything is gloriously vivid, colorful, and bursting with life.The manner in which Miyazaki presents the narrative is nothing short of brilliant. The whole time watching the film, we as an audience realize that the girls' mother is suffering from some kind of serious affliction, but this is never really addressed directly. The children don't think about it that way, so the film doesn't approach it that way. This subplot never really develops at all until a sequence near the very end of the film, and this is a very powerful sequence. In order to avoid spoilers, I won't reveal the details, but it certainly struck me with its bittersweet honesty. However, this is still a tender family film through and through, and the ending is one that is sure to bring a smile to your face. And unlike most family films, My Neighbor Totoro is sweet, but never reaches the point of being saccharine. It's an honest, beautiful masterpiece, and I give it my highest recommendation to anyone who can still manage to keep in touch with their inner child from time to time.","

He asks for it constantly-- it is completely non-violent, and we don't mind letting him watch once or twice a day. So, I have probably seen it a hundred times by now, but I am still enjoying it and seeing and hearing new details. The film respectfully portrays so many slippery nuances of childhood--powerful emotions, unexpected perceptions, and secret worlds of adventure. I think our baby might like it because it's helping him learn how to be a little kid. He loves the music, the tree, the baby girl Mei, the Dad, the catbus, and especially the totoro (although this is also the scariest part for him).I would highly recommend this film for anyone except adolescents, who might find it sort of dull and goody-goody.","

Thats about it. This is probably the most over rated film from Miyazaki, the uber over rated Japanese anime director.Its all done in a pastel tone animated style that looks like an a painting by a first grader, yet some of the backgrounds do have a certain charm to them.There is no edge, conflict, sense of menace or real emotion or drama in this pablum coated film to engage the audience. Even a 3 year old would become bored-fast. Done by Studio Ghibli-a sort of Japanese Disney studio, this turkey has earned much yen since its release. Not to mention the merchandising it has inspired that, fortunately is not too readily available in the United States. And can anybody please tell me what is so great about Miyazaki? He's just another ""in it for the money"" artist like Tim Burton, Spielberg, and Murakami. As a matter of fact, I have a hard time distinguishing Miyazaki from Murakami.. Even Spielberg's ""ET"", a film that I thoroughly hated seems enjoyable and well made when compared to this. Do yourself a favor-watch it only if you have to. Not worth your precious time.For some reason, this was one of the the highest grossing film of all time in Japan until Titanic came along. I can't see why.","

"bruhperson","7 March 2019","You know when you're a kid and you just want to be independent? You want to become an adult once and for all? And later on when you're there realize that being a kid was the best moment of your life? This movie, plus its great OST achieves making me nostalgic, making me feel like a little kid again. Yes, you have these high budget animated movies like The Lion King, but they're movies for kids, not a movie to make you feel that nostalgia. My Neighbor Totoro's main theme captures this perfectly. If you could only go back to those beautiful times, when nothing mattered, wen you could play all day and run around the house...

"Irishchatter","28 September 2015","I have to say that this is the worst film I have ever seen like seriously why did they put whiny characters in this?? god it has had given me a headache! Also that scene where the father and the girls are in the bath. Whats more disturbing is that the little girl looked as if she sat on his genitals. I swear like you call this a child's film???? OK so I know it said that in the east that the bathroom can be shared with the family but at the same time, you think to yourself, is he a good father after all? Like you would hope he doesn't turn out to be a pedophile because those girls are quite young! Honest to god, I think this film is very bad on the eyes especially mine, I wouldn't show this to kids, god no!","

The characters are all so lovable, I marvel at Hayao miyazaki's ability to create something truly imaginative out of every standard object. The film is visually beautiful and wondrous. What was also heart warming was the relationship between the father, mother and kiddies, it's everybody's ideal family unit. It reflected well the older sister younger sister relationship, leaving the viewer feeling very nostalgic. The cat embodied everything that a child desires from a companion. The film managed to capture the world that children live in and take you back to what it felt like to be a child living in your own idealist environment. Basically i feel it's impossible for anybody to watch this film and be left feeling cold. It warms you from your toes to the tip of your head, you'll be smiling for days.","

"Jozinek","3 May 2022","If you want a lovely animated movie to watch if you're perhaps feeling down, or if you have kids, or if you just want to watch something pleasant with the whole family etc. Then My Neighbour Totoro is a highly suitable film for such occasions. It's charming, with beautiful artwork, animation, and music. The pacing may be slow and most of the time barely anything happens, but it's still worth watching. A very simple film about two little girls meeting and befriending forest spirits while moving into a new home with their father, all while their mother is ill and in hospital. Most of the film focuses on them, Totoro and the other forest spirits being occasional highlights throughout the film. It's not action packed or exciting but it doesn't need to be. It's supposed to be a soothing, cute movie with themes of youth, friendship, and family. So, if that sounds appealing to you, I suggest giving it a try.","

"dballred","31 October 2002","I saw this film for the first time on Japanese television a couple of years ago. This is one of the few feel-good films I ever saw that drove this normally left-brained engineer to a teary-eyed sentimentality. It is a story about two sisters, Mei and her elder sister Satsuki, who had just moved to a house in the country. Their father, a teacher, looks after them as their mother is ill in the hospital. While playing in the garden, Mei sees a strange furry character and takes after it. The events that follow lead her and Satsuki to a wondrous backyard adventure with magical creatures. Are they real? Imaginary? This film has a cuteness factor that runs off the scale. As it is with most Japanese films, it really needs to be seen in its original language form, subtitled if necessary, rather than the dubbed VHS and DVD forms available in the US.","

It tells a cute, short story packed with memorable moments.

Although the theme is very simple, it's very well drawn and the characters move very well (I got surprised with the animation of the movement of the two girls: they really seem real!)If you're going to watch or buy it, remember it's a movie _for children_. It's designed in that way, and it's great in that way, so don't expect a great story because it hasn't it. If you want something ""serious"" go for Kokaku Kidotai, Hotaru no Haka (excellent), Nausicaa, Mononoke Hime (these last two by Miyazaki too) or even one of the Rupan Sansei (Lupin III) saga, instead.My rating: 9/10 (again, as a movie designed for children).","

In 1999, Miramax released Mononoke Hime into U.S. theaters. I saw it three times during its theatrical run and six times on video. When I looked up Miyazaki's filmogrophy I saw that he directed Totoro. I knew that I had to see it one way or another. About four weeks ago I bought the import DVD and I watched it again. I fell in love with it again. It's probably the cutest movie ever. The creature Totoro is the best ""cute-thing"" ever to hit the silver screen. Mei and Satsuki are brilliant. If you don't have time to see the whole movie then just watch the bus-stop scene. Brilliant! You can never go wrong with Miyazaki. Disney (U.S.) could never get a project like this off the ground without screwing it up royally and adding musical numbers. EVERYBODY LOVES TOTORO! Grade: A","

"pieman","13 May 1999","Two things always come into my mind when I think of this movie. One is the pacing. And one is the clouds.Let's talk about the clouds first. They're really amazing. Whenever I look outside and see those same big, puffy, sunny-day clouds, I always tell my kids, ""Those are Totorro Clouds."" This is of course just one example of the amazing drawing and animation in this movie. Beautiful interior shots with amazing detail. Great drawings of people, although I'll never understand why anime always includes the huge round eyes and the cavernous mouths. There's the one scene where the tree grows all the way up to the sky. All hand drawn, it compares favorably to the best computer-assisted animation by Disney, Dreamworks, or the rest. It's just simply beautiful.Now on to pacing. The thing that really amazes me about this movie (and the thing that makes it superior to the other movies by this director) is that it is such a small, simple little story. Two young girls, ages about 4 and 7 I'm guessing, go out to the country with their father to be near their seriously ill, convalescing mother. Because of their stress, it seems, they meet some comforting mythological creatures who give them a ride around and then take them back home. That's about it.There are long, drawn-out scenes in the kitchen and in the family bath that you'd never catch in a Disney film. The most beautiful scene of all is that of the two girls waiting at the bus stop for their father to come home from work. They must wait on screen for at least a few minutes. It's astonishingly shocking and effective in its lack of activity. American filmmakers, who are always claiming that their animation is not just meant for children, still feel the need to pack every second of their movies with nonstop noise and action. Totorro, on the other hand, has the pacing you'd hope for if you moved out to the country. It's a simple, melancholy little film that just strikes me as so damn true to life.I've got plenty of younger friends who are totally into the more hardcore anime, like Akira and Ghost in the Shell. I always tell them to watch this movie. Now they're all fans as well.","

"iamakitten","7 February 2010","If you are sick of taking your children to see movies written by Disney where their intelligence will be insulted by stereotypical and unrealistic representations of children, consider showing them Totoro.It is everything Disney is incapable of creating.. intelligent and heart warming with believable characters. Hayao Miyazaki doesn't need to rely on the same old cheap tricks to keep his movies interesting because he has something special.. he hasn't lost touch with the innocence and wonder of being a child, which is why he's so perfectly able to represent Mei and Satsuki's emotions and draw you into their world in this movie.It isn't action packed or epic, but it doesn't need to be because it is far more special, individual and unique than any ""children's"" movie created in the last twenty years. This isn't a movie to be appreciate by children only, it is one of the rare movies that will be appreciated on different levels by viewers of all ages.You must watch Totoro, and I would highly recommend watching it in subtitled format. The American voice actors do not demonstrate the ability of their Japanese counterparts and reduce the enjoyability of the movie greatly.","

And this is not for young child, teenager maybe.The climax and high points are not plot based. Some sequences are not plot linked. There are dream sequences and reality mixing together. And which is which may not be explained. It is to be breath in.You won't be overwhelm with a detail intricate story but rather detail intricate, thoughtfully translated emotions.

But a few years later I saw it in my video store and gave it a chance, and it has become one of my favorite films of all time. It's beautifully animated and was directed/written by Miyazaki, who I think is the master of Anime (believe me, I've seen a lot of Anime in my day). The story is about two girls who move to the countryside and befriend a friendly forest monster, who gives them hope and helps them out. Great script, great animation and they adapted the Japanese songs perfectly. A must see film for all ages.","

They meet Granny, who helps them to move in the house and is a farmer. The reason that they moved there was because of a gigantic camfer tree.( which looks like about the size of the Empire State Bulding.) When they move in, they find dust bunnies, little creatures made of dust.(of course.) One day Mei Finds a little white thing that can turn invisible. Later, she sees a medium sized blue one with a sack of acorns. Then she goes into the forest and finds the large gray one. The totoros take the two on adventures, and help them deal with their mother in the hospital. A great film and is highly entertaining. In the beginning, the dialog is very annoying.","

"arthera09","16 September 2007","I love this movie. Miyazaki can do a movie like no other and his magic shows in any movie. I started noticing the influence WW2 had on film makes like this and I think this movie captures it in a fun childish way that does not loose it power. The character design was amazing from the girls to all of the creatures. I think that Miyazaki can pull off taking a pretty empty shot and using to keep the pace of the movie without it being obvious, but then it picks up and it just turns into a whirlwind of magic. The tragic nature of a lot of Japanese film and the way of coping with it by creating a fantastical world where dreams literally come true. I think one of the nice things at the end of the movie that no one including the parents and the audience don't believe in the magic that propels the movie. At times it is a little scary, but in a good way, but nothing horrible every really happens. The only reason this movie does not get a 10 is because when watching any Miyazaki film one inevitably compares it to his other films and I do not think this top spirited away, but has a place in every movie library.","

Neighbours claim that the house is haunted and pretty soon it looks like they might be correct... Then one day Mei wanders into the forest and discovers an interesting creature, Totoro...The first and, so far, only Hayao Miyazaki movie I've liked, and I've seen all six of his movies that are in the IMDb Top 250. Generally his movies start well, with an intriguing, imaginative set up. However, they tend to quickly degenerate into a rambling adventure for a plot with random action scenes and equally random solutions to problems, and no character depth or engagement. Pretty much suitable for kids only.However, My Neighbour Totoro is different. There's no rambling adventure or random action scenes, but a sweet, focused story. The characters have depth and are likable and engaging. The plot develops gradually and meticulously. There's a beautiful child-like sense of discovery and wonder to the movie.Nice, emotional ending too.Kids will love it but it is ideal for all ages.","

"jordondave-28085","29 October 2023","(1988) My Neighbor Totoro
DUBBED
JAPAN ANIMATION/ FAMILYI remembered at the time of this film's release, critics were calling this film 'anti- Disney' because it has no singing and dancing, no protagonist and antagonist, bad or good, good or evil, just a subtle story with a lot of made-up creatures serving as a back drop to nurture very kids whenever they may need any help. The last time Disney ever release one without any singing and dancing was in 1985 called ""The Black Cauldron"" and didn't do too well at the box office, but it still consisted of a lot of good and evil! The film that solidified Hideo Miyazaki's name on the map was this one and with each repeated viewing as an adult I can relate more and more with it's subtle messages even if it's intended as a children's picture, for instance the need to have both parents and the effects of a single parent looking after a child. The film which does not say whether it is a good or a bad thing but does show what underage kids can do as a result, such as in this case run away from home! One would have to wonder why it had to be this film that people had come and take notice since Hideo has been drawing animation for a very long time, and how come this one had to do well as opposed to other ones he did earlier such as ""Lupin"", ""Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind"" and 'Castle in the Sky"" and I think the reason is that they still consisted of some Walt Disney themes such as good and bad, dark and evil ! And as aforementioned this was originally not a hit once released here in North America distributed by 20th Century Fox because of the heavy marketing of many Disney cartoons and of course ""My Neighbor Totoro"" was very limited. After this film, Japanese audiences wanted to see more like it with the beautiful wilderness as well as the creatures thought up by actual children, and in turn used this film as a basis for his later works from ""Kiki- the Delivery Service"", to ""Princess Mononoke"" to ""Spirited Away"". Hollywood even made their own Miyazaki-like film called ""Up"" which has done well with adults and children alike and would've made Myazki proud for starting this whole new phenomenon started with this film! Out of all the reviews from RT of bonafide critics- the review that may have made me appreciate this film even more is the review by James O' Ehley! Footnote: 20th Century Fox was it's first distributor for My Neighbor Totoro with unknown voices doing the dubbing until Disney bought the rights to all the Myazaki films and to avoid paying any royalties re-dubbed all the voices again from unknown voices to celebrity voices such as Dakota Fanning and her sister which is distracting since we are accustomed to know what they sound like.","

The art is beautiful, and the breathtaking scenes and Totoro's mysterious adorableness both really awaken our inner child's curiosity and awe.

"muathuvn","25 September 2005","I love Totoro, Mei and Satsuki. I have been seeing the movie many times without getting bored while I become tired of seeing other movies easily right at the second or third time. I can't imagine how the director can create such real and cute characters. Notice the way Mei goes upstairs and downstairs, showing Myazaki to be very observant about children's actions. They are amazing compared to conventional move of Waldisney's as well as of many other animated movies. The movie is a simple story with normal circumstances of daily life, about a family with 4 members, the father is a university professor, the mother is in hospital because of suffering from a disease unknown and the two children of 10 and 4 years old are still very innocent. The family is as ordinary as most of real families around us but described within several selective days. That is when they move to a new house in the beautiful countryside. The fresh scene encourages the two children to discover everything they see and this leads them to meeting with Totoro. Totoro is only a character of imagination but more real than any other imagined characters. He looks like a bear and may symbol children's belief in good things of life. One of the scenes i like best is that of the three people bathing together when a very serious storm goes through the area, shaking the house and scaring the two children, so warm. And the scenes of field, hills remind me of my childhood as if it was just yesterday. For me this is Myazaki's best animated movie and one of the best animations of all time. Voted it 10 stars.","

Their mother is battling cancer and staying at a near by hospital where they frequently visit. As hopes of their mother returning home peaks and crashes the sisters are taken on an emotional rollercoaster. When the youngest sister discovers her mom isn't coming home she sets out to find her own way to the hospital to see her mom and gets lost. The oldest sister, her family and friends, including the spirits, set out to find her...This movie is directed by Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away) and contains the voices of Dakota Fanning (Man on Fire), Elle Fanning (Super 8), Tim Daly (Wings) and Matt Adler (Teen Wolf).The storyline for this has amazing depth with great characters and solid sub plots. The family dynamic is very well established and it's easy to root for them as the story unfolds. The super natural elements are very unique and creative and do a great job of capturing the imagination. How the super natural elements are woven into the storyline is fantastic.Overall this is an all time great animated picture that is an absolutely must see.

"Bunuel1976","10 November 2006","This is my fourth film from this celebrated animation artist; while I've always enjoyed his work, I still feel that it's somewhat overrated. The ones I'd watched - PRINCESS MONONOKE (1997), SPIRITED AWAY (2001; his best, in my opinion) and HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (2004) - were all plot-packed, overwhelming visual experiences, so I was surprised to find this one much simpler, virtually kiddie-oriented and essentially plot less! It was still meticulously detailed and inventive, with two extremely likable female protagonists and equally delightful anthropomorphic characters - not to mention an infectious title track. I've yet to catch up with quite a number of his films (TCM showed a retrospective of his work while I was in Hollywood late last year, but I didn't have the time - or stamina - for them) but, given their basic similarity, I guess it's best to approach them one at a time (my local DVD rental outlet does carry a few more titles, though)...","

It also shows kids behaving as kids behave, with sibling rivalry, throwing tantrums at the unfairness of the world, imagining ghosts and magical creatures (practically channeling Alice in Wonderland in going down the rabbit hole), and also looking out for one another when the chips are down. There is such vulnerability here, as the mother is in the hospital and the kids are sometimes on their own, discovering things in the world, including Totoro. It might have been too wholesome for me to fully appreciate as an adult, but it's certainly a quality production, and heartwarming.","

Brief Review -Perhaps the cutest Japanese Animated Film but Hayao Miyazaki films don't fancy me. In animation genre i have seen plenty of classics made by Hollywood but don't know why i never liked foreign language films made in the same genre very much. Although i am a big fan of feature films made in foreign languages, this animation world seems feeble by far. I can see many Miyazaki's films in Top Rated 250 IMDb films list and that's why i had to watch them but not a single film managed to impress me. I would say it with no murmurs that i didn't find any of his film deserving to be here in this list. My Neighbor Totoro is most probably my last film of this director and i won't be seeing any of his animated flick now on, i am happy watching Classics of Pixar. So, this film is about two little girls who shift into a mythy ghost house with their father leaving mother behind at hospital. They sneak out in the forest nearby and befriends animalistic spirits. How this spirit of Totoro brings happiness in their life is all we got to see in My Neighbor Totoro. I don't know what's so there in this film to like it beyond what it deserves and then put it alongside some universal classics. Undoubtedly this is the cutest japanese film i have till date but just cuteness doesn't fill everything right. There should be something called innovative, creative sort of work to make a strong impact which is missing here. May be it is because the film was made in late 80s and therefore looks outdated but i have enjoyed watching many Hollywood classic animation flicks made before 60s. Those films didn't look outdated or extremely common like this. I am not being too harsh but i watched this film with high expectations and then found nothing in there so the frustration might be causing some extra bashing here. Overall, it is Good but not Great, not even close it.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest","

"ronaldotheheel","29 October 2002","This is what kid's movies should be like. A movie without a villain, a movie realistic enough to believe the story could be real, a movie surreal enough to let kid's imagination compell them long after the movie is over. This movies was made for the good of the world, and it remids us that we can have a wonderful experiance at the movies without drugs, sex, and violence. 10 stars! ""No Totoro"" about it!","

"ziancara","12 April 2023","""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a timeless classic that has captured the hearts of audiences young and old since its release in 1988. Directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli, the film tells the story of two young sisters who move to the countryside with their father and encounter a forest spirit named Totoro.One of the greatest strengths of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is its ability to evoke a sense of childlike wonder and nostalgia in its viewers. The film is filled with moments of pure joy and imagination, such as the scene in which Mei and Satsuki first discover Totoro and the Catbus, a magical creature that can transport them anywhere in the world. Miyazaki expertly captures the essence of childhood, with all its innocence, curiosity, and boundless creativity.Another standout aspect of the film is its stunning animation and artwork. Studio Ghibli's trademark attention to detail is on full display, with lush backgrounds and intricately designed creatures that transport the viewer into the magical world of the film. From the towering camphor tree to the adorable Totoro himself, every element of the film is lovingly crafted to create a fully immersive experience for the viewer.In addition to its visual splendor, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" also boasts a beautiful musical score by composer Joe Hisaishi. The music perfectly captures the whimsical, fantastical tone of the film, and is sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches it.Despite its reputation as a children's film, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is also notable for its themes of family, friendship, and the importance of taking care of the natural world. The film encourages its viewers to slow down, appreciate the beauty of the world around them, and connect with others in meaningful ways. In today's fast-paced, technology-driven world, this message is more important than ever.While ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is undoubtedly a beloved classic, it is not without its flaws. Some viewers may find the film's slow pacing and lack of a traditional narrative structure to be a bit off-putting. Additionally, some of the themes and cultural references may be difficult for Western audiences to fully grasp without some background knowledge of Japanese culture.Overall, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a delightful, enchanting film that is sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches it. Its timeless themes, stunning animation, and childlike sense of wonder make it a true masterpiece of the animated film genre.

"ElMaruecan82","22 December 2017","Miyazaki's movies demand more viewings, not because they're too complex, but because their narratives and visuals are so rich you can easily miss a detail. 
Still, ""Totoro"" looked startlingly simple and straight-forward, there wasn't much intrigue, or even character-development, it's not even a coming-of-age story, despite being a childhood adventure and while there's no villain, there's no conflict whatsoever to enhance the dramatic outlook.But it's precisely for these reasons that I watched it again, and this time, I had the proper key to open my heart and let the magic operate: my daughter who's the same age as Mei, four years (actually she just celebrated it today). We saw the cartoon together and I didn't miss any detail, I couldn't since each scene she asked me question, about the soot sprites, the haunted house, why are they laughing in the bath, why are their little dark things leaving the house? And I had to pay attention to all these tiny details because she wouldn't miss one, just like Mei... and then I realized that Miyazaki understood children.I said this is a children movie; less because it deals with children but because it's oriented toward children. And maybe it's because Mei is the smallest one that she could spot these rabbit-like ears in the grass and then discover a white little creature with the same role than the white rabbit in ""Alice in Wonderland"". But Miyazaki doesn't use that scene for a narrative purpose, if he cared for narrative, the titular Totoro would have appeared fifteen minutes earlier. Miyazaki sets the mood, he lets us contemplate the place, the house and the beautiful nature with that watercolor quality so typical of the anime style.As usual there are many long moments where nothing happens, or nothing special, which is the antithesis of screen writing but the essence of life, sometimes, things take time to happen. And we have almost thirty seconds where Mei is trying to catch the little rabbit and we see nothing else, except for a butterfly entering from the other side of a cabin and getting out from the hole Mei is staring at. I hadn't noticed that butterfly before and it didn't change much to my comprehension of the film but its adorable randomness made me smile. Never underestimate the appeal of 'insignificant' details.Finally, Mei spots the rabbit and he's following a bigger one, the two run away leaving nuts and seeds on the ground and after a chase across the forest, she finally lands near the hollow of a camphor tree where Totoro is sleeping. What a delightfully anticlimactic entrance! Myazaki's most iconic creation just lying there and being slightly disturbed by a small girl. We're not even sure his name is Totoro, it seems to be the way she interpreted his repeated roars... or yawns. Mei baptizes him Totoro and seems to be the only privileged kid to see her, for a while.But here again, Miyazaki avoids all the clichés of the genre, Mei's father believes her and explains that the creature is probably the master of the forest or some protective spirit. And her sister Satsuki while the voice of wisdom at the age of 10 and the substitute mother... envies her kid sister. Miyazaki understands children so much that he grasps the different layers of childhood representing them like the small and average rabbit, he knows a kid of four will be playful and incapable of reasoning or being reasoned while an older one will still be innocent but aware of the tough implications of the world.But once Totoro is there, Satsuki and Mei are both incarnations of the spirit of childhood, they literally jump at his tummy and fly together, this is a magnificent scene but we've seen flying already in Miyazaki, how about perhaps the most iconic moment where the two sisters and Totoro wait for a bus, and Satsuki gives him an umbrella. We talked about moments where nothing happens, whatever this scene is supposed to mean is secondary beyond the fact it inspires a wild smile and a certain warmth... and that it introduces the second iconic creation of Myazaki, the Chesire-like cat-bus. 
Only a mind that understands children can be that creative... and Miyazaki knows childhood with the same intelligence as he respects ours, he knows the kids won't jump in the cat-bus, they're waiting for their father. For all the magic and fantasy the film carries, it's only because it's rooted in the reality of the world, incarnated by the beautiful landscapes or the sickness of the mother or relationships between parents and children or inter-generational, that we're transported by Totoro. He only pops up when reality is sometimes too tough to handle, even for children.And I can't imagine any children not being responsive to the film, Walt Disney said that every film should have morale, for every laugh there should be a tear, that one scare or two can be stimulating but while ""My Neighbor Totoro"" has some dramatic tension, this is a film consistently gentle and sweet about its own material as if a world where Totoro didn't need villains or antagonists to make its point. As ifTotoro was the master of the film, spiritually. 
Miyazaki took that gentle approach we'll also find in movies like ""Kiki"" or ""Ponyo"", with a basic story and not too fancy animation but a huge emotional outlook just like ""Dumbo"" was the most popular Disney film while not as sophisticated as ""Fantasia"" or ambitious as ""Bambi"". But ""Totoro"" is more than a Japanese Dumbo, it's an icon so popular even the opening song (a catchy march tune) became a children rhyme. No wonder it became the Studio mascot. And since the name refers to an airplane engine. You have the essence of Miyazaki's creation in that blue cardboard opening in each of his films.","

"CinemaClown","24 April 2014","Magically capturing the beauty & innocence of childhood, My Neighbor Totoro is a magnificent example of hand-drawn animation from Studio Ghibli. Set in a rural village in post-war Japan, it tells the story of two little girls who move to a new place with their father so that they can be near to the hospital where their mother is recovering from a long-term illness and covers the little girls' adventures with the wood spirits living in a nearby forest.Directed by world's renowned artist Hayao Miyazaki, My Neighbor Totoro isn't any conflicted or tragic story but is simply a reflection & celebration of life & its little adventures. The childhood of the two girls portrayed here is extremely convincing, the fanciful creatures including Totoro are freshly imagined, the 2D animation mirrors a beautiful painting, the voice actors are lively in their roles & the music is as heartwarming as it is soothing.On an overall scale, My Neighbor Totoro is a nostalgic journey of childhood, an adventure for all ages & a subtle commentary about the depleting relationship between humans & nature. It brings on screen some wondrous creatures of fantasy & yet remains grounded throughout its runtime. A simple, heartfelt & joyous cinema that takes us through little bits of every emotion, My Neighbor Totoro is a cinematic gem that viewers are going to cherish for a long, long time.","

"Cylex","26 September 2001","Apart from annoying title songs, there is little to dislike about this movie. I usually avoid Manga because it's too violent but this one departs from the norm. There are no villians. The totoro are gentle creatures with powers over nature. My favourite is the Cat Bus. There's no real plot but the animation is exquisite. The only threat is that the girls' mother is seriously ill. This may worry younger children but this is a film that everyone can relate to. It is about life and family values. One not to be missed.  9/10","

"ericstevenson","21 February 2017","I remember looking up on Amazon.com and seeing that this film was seemingly the most reviewed anime thing on the entire website! It was that alone that made me want to watch this. Yeah, I'm like that. I admit that I was confused as to how a lot of the movie didn't really focus on the title character. He didn't even appear until 32 minutes into the movie! Now, this is still a great movie. You simply can't go wrong with this animation from the creator of ""Castle In The Sky"" which I looked at recently. I am so impressed at how this artwork holds up after all these decades. Honestly, it seems on par with his newest stuff like ""Ponyo""! I had no idea that they were actually going to get into some pretty deep issues here. This movie features two daughters whose mother is away sick. In this sense, it actually improves on better movies like ""Spirited Away"" because we actually get to see the supernatural stuff weaved into their everyday lives. It also helps that they have this awesome catbus. Yeah, literally a giant cat that's also a bus. It makes little sense, but dang do I love looking at that guy. I'm surprised at how short it was, seeing as how Miyazaki was known for making longer films. ***1/2","

"ThomasDrufke","18 February 2015","I think everyone can enjoy a good family film every once in awhile, especially when it's directed by the genius Hayao Miyazaki. He always finds the right mix of fantastical imagination with real heartwarming material. While I think My Neighbor Totoro is a good film, it's nowhere near his best. It explores the relationship between big and little sister, but also people dealing with a difficult situation in life. And sometimes that's when your imagination is at it's highest.It starts off pretty slow, and we don't actually get to see Totoro for about 20 minutes, but when we do the film takes a big jump in quality. A child's imagination is something that is only understood if you have had the same imagination at some point in your life. I remember the days of pretending I had other friends and creatures who would join me on my own adventures. So I can definitely relate to Mei and Satsuki. I think a better film for this would probably be Spirited Away, but it's nonetheless an enjoyable ride. The last 15 minutes or so are really touching. I loved all of the family moments, including their forest family.So Miyazaki has another heartwarming animated feature to his repertoire, but it falls short of the greatness of Spirited Away or even Howl's Moving Castle.+Touching +Imaginative +Totoro is so welcoming -Slow start -Could have been even more fantastical 7.0/10","

When you have seen these masterpiece of Hayao Miyazaki the least you expect is an another masterpiece and he did not let me down for one more time.""My Neighbour Totoro"" is again a very good movie of Hayao Miyazaki and it has to do with two girls who have adventures with the wondrous forest spirits who live nearby their house. In this movie Hayao Miyazaki wants to show us once more the link between people and spirits and he did it very well.Because I saw this movie after I saw ""Spirited Away"" I compare it with this movie and I found out that these two movies have some things in common such as the link between people and spirits and their interaction.","

"estreet-eva","6 December 2011","You won't see the brilliance of some of the later Miyazaki films (""Spirited Away"", ""Kiki Delivery Service"", ""Howl's Moving Castle"", etc.) in this early (1988) Studio Ghibli production. Some of the trademark Miyazaki visually arresting elements are there - particularly the fantastic catbus. His mastery of artistic representations of natural elements (rainstorms, waves, etc.) which made ""Spirited Away"" and ""Ponyo"" such true works of art are here only in a pale reflection. ""Tonari No Totoro"" also does not delve into epic storytelling of war and environmental collapse as the later works do but does tell an mildly uplifting child's story of coping with sickness and displacement using the power of imagination. In short, if you are already a fan of Miyazaki, you should see the film to round out your experience. If not eschew this one in favor of his later more mature work.","

The characters' lives have been upended by their mother's unspecified illness, but this crisis provides an opening for them to encounter forest spirits, including the titular Totoro, who resembles a giant rabbit.In typically bizarre anime style, there's also a giant bus that's shaped like a cat.

I read a lot about Grave of the Fireflies and upon watching it, made me feel human again. I heard about Tonari no Totoro around the same time I heard of Grave of the Fireflies, however I did not have the money to obtain Tonari no Totoro.I had the chance to watch this film and loved it when I watched it. Basically the film is about a family, two sisters and their father who move into a new house.

"johnnyboyz","20 March 2013","My Neighbour Totoro is a sweet, pleasing little romp; an animation with some colourful landscapes and sweet, likable child leads whose frolicking and sheer bounce are often the engine room to the film's otherwise empty sense of energy. Sadly, and for all its plaudits, the film comes off as ultimately a bit of an inconsequence - it isn't exciting, nor particularly memorable: there is little conflict; little drama and the film is extraordinarily light on narrative and character. If I told you the film was about a child encountering monsters given these things, you might raise an eyebrow. However, if I told you the monsters, instead of being scary, were themselves scared of an energetic, boisterous human presence then you might be able to put two-and-two together in that the animation is less interested in delivering the generic thrills and spills that come with such a premise and more interested in exploration and revisionism. That's fine, of course; but when the charm of such an idea has worn off and the approach to have it both ways in its grounded depiction of a dramatic reality (alá Ocean Waves or Only Yesterday) mixed with fruiter, more escapist Ghibli fare driven by encounters with odd animals, we are not left with much in which to get interested nor with which to stay invested.At its heart is a tale of a young child meeting creatures not of this world, but the creatures are more interested in catching up on sleep than anything else. They meet, hang out, learn to be in one another's presence, get along fine and that's the end of it. This is, of course, only to a face value; look deeper and you'll see that this is a film about a child being brave in the face of new surroundings; of learning how to act in the company of strangers; of accepting predicaments and, it seems, coming to quite enjoy eating one's vegetables.Two playful young sisters named Satsuki and Mei are in the process of moving into a new home with their father in decades-ago Japan, an abode in the country; secluded and rural. Their existence is happy, jovial; they are easily excited and very enthusiastic in their nature. Upon arrival, there are some relatively uninteresting frolicking around; the kids get wind of would-be real/unreal creatures that already occupy the premises: little grey sprites that live in the walls and dart about when no one's looking out of fear of the fresh human occupants. This allows the film to play with a child's fear of the dark; their gradual discomfort of being in a new space and the sense of excitement abound with all these things combined as exploration beckons, and we're never sure if horror or soft-core adventure is the order of the day here. It's both – on occasion not either. Whatever the choice, rarely does the film feel like it's going anywhere or with the aspiration to truly take off.The kids lack a mother. She rears up out of the blue later on, in an ill-advised manner when it's revealed she's suffering from depression. It's here the issues with the overall approach to My Neighbour Totoro rear up, since it was never that sort of film in the first place, and I find it difficult not to resent the piece for dragging us down that path when the whole subplot arrives. At the core of it lies a friendship Mei strikes up with the titular Totoro, her ""neighbour"" as it were, in that he lives nearby just beyond the bushes and undergrowth of the gardens. Totoro is an animal not of this world; a sort of egg shaped creature who looks a little like a rabbit but is about as big as a small tree He sleeps. He sleeps a lot. He says very little, and is enormous, but appears friendly in spite of the fact he could fit all of Mei inside of his mouth.Where he is docile, she is this continuous presence of excitement and activity but the film cannot muster up much excitement or interest when these two of such a binary opposition come together. In spite of the character's inherent lack of anything at all that may be interesting, it hasn't stopped the companies shipping millions of Totoro die-cast toys; this is in spite of him essentially being someone so uncharacteristic, and so dull in their existence, that I'm hard pressed not to say they are the most lifeless, least likable Ghibli character I can think who's of a supernatural sort. Totoro has his obligatory access to all sorts of magic and friends and avenues to adventure, and Mei comes to interact with them. They fly around and plant seeds and everyone has fun. At least, it looked like they did. The film carries on. Everyone's getting along fine; no one believes Mei: of course they don't, although the father finds room to play along with the fantasy. The whole thing is sufficient, innocuous nonsense that's ultimately too childish to explore the darker passages inherent in within it, and too inconsequential to motivate much interest in the central fantasy tract.","

I think Stephen Spielberg is a master story teller too. What both of these men have in common for me is the ability to touch a nerve when every they tell their story, and they do it constantly even with their bad movies.But My Neighbor Totoro is not a bad movie. it's a very good movie. One of Miyazaki's best. What I like about it mostly is the animation itself, it just moves so beautifully, like the best animation should. I'm use to the action packed superhero, slapstick kind of animation and despite it's quiet story set in Japan's quiet countryside, the movement of the animation made it so exciting in this anime.So the movie is about two girls who moved to the country side with their father to be close to their ill mother ( Miyazaki has use the whole movie to the country to handle illness a few time since this movie like in The Wind Rises). The girls have adventures with the forest spirits that live there.It's a beautiful tale told by a master storyteller.http://cinemagardens.com","

"tjsdomer2","28 July 2016","I can't say enough of the animation, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Despite this, I'm not sure what message the film sends, besides being a child-like distraction. Maybe that's the point, and I guess that's OK for kids, but nothing really stands out in a cohesive way for adults. Another possible message involves the tension between childish innocence (as represented by Totoro?) and the worries of growing into adulthood, though I'm not entirely sure what that message is other than being true prima facie.All in all, the film is too ambiguous in the conflict department, and as a result is lacking in immersion for the viewer. Even children's films deserve better than this. Though also a flawed and somewhat rambling film, I prefer Spirited Away.My Neighbor Totoro gets 2 out of 4 stars.","

"kormakur_g","18 December 2002","Having seen all of Hayao Miyazaki's films I think I can safely say that My Neighbour Totoro is his finest piece. It captures the wonder and magic of childhood and makes you cry with joy. Literally. The film tells the story of two sisters, Mei and Satsuki, who move into an old house in the Japanese countryside with their father, only to find it haunted with Soot Sprites. The girls' exploration of the neighbouring countryside leads them to Totoro, a giant furry, benevolent forest spirit. From then on it's pure adventure and laughter. Almost. Unlike nearly all other children's films, Totoro has no villain, no evildoer or wicked granny. Though Satsuki and Mei must face emotional hardship it is simply the hardship we must all face. Sickness and mortality.Though it's become a cliche, here it rings true; this film is for children all ages. I've shown this movie to all my friends: jaded and cynical film enthusiasts yet they all fall prey to this film's charm and sincerity. See it.","

"tommystans","13 May 2014","I've heard so much about this film for years but never had the time too. However I bought myself the DVD, along with a Blu-Ray version of 'Howl's Moving Castle', another of Miyazaki's great work. And with its fantastic storytelling and 2D animation I was fascinated by its work. The characters are memorable, the music brings out some emotion and the story was nice and simple and is not like the many kids films were it needs to have a hero, a villain etc. it's just a story of two little girls who have an imagination of a bear character known as Totoro. As kids films do have a message, like most of the director's great work, it's hard to underly what the message is of the film, most idiots may 'think' that Totoro is the symbol of death, when really he isn't as the mother in the hospital was OK, look at the end credits, and that the shoe that was found in the pond was not Mei's at all. To me I think there is no message, it's just a fun film to escape the depths of reality. As of the voice acting for the US audience I prefer the Disney version. I never grew up with the Fox one but I've seen it and the voice acting is just stiff, loud and awful, I'm sorry if I've offended fans of the 1993 dub, but not everyone is a nostalgic hipster and are not blinded by the rose coloured glasses of nostalgia. The Disney's version, before anyone asks Disney is the distributor and dubbing work of the Ghibli films for the English audience. The latter version is better as the voice actors were better. Their voices are more relaxed, realistic and great, especially the fanning sisters. I think Totoro is one of the greatest animated films of all time and probably one of the greatest movies of all time. It's a very inspiring piece of work that it fuels up my dream of becoming an animator and writer. If you have the chance to see the movie with your kids or if you're a big Miayzaki or Studio Ghibli fan I recommend buying this DVD.","

"freemantle_uk","10 April 2011","We all know Hayao Miyazaki is an anime genius, creating stories focusing on character, story and fantasy, letting his imagine run wild. He has created great films like Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke. My Neighbour Totoro is considered one of his first great works.Mr. Kusakabe (Shigesato Itoi) and his two daughters Satsuki (Noriko Hidaka) and Mei (Chika Sakamoto) move to a new home in rural Japan so they could be close to their sick mother (Sumi Shimamoto). They new home is run down and filled with soot spirits, but the family soon settle in. One day Mei meets a strange giant creature called Totoro, a large furry animal who has two minions. No one believes Mei at first but after Mei disappears Satsuki has to call Totoro for help.My Neighbour Totoro is a strange little film, but Miyazaki does have an understanding of a child's imagine (either that or he takes a lot powerful narcotics). There is a certain Alice in Wonderland feel about the film, with Mei going down a hole and Totoro and the Catbus (one of the weirdest ideas ever) looking like the Chester Cat. But the main focus of the film is the relationship between the young girls and the their father who is obviously overwhelmed with his caring for the girls, having a wife in hospital and continuing with his job. The children are energetic and believable and the film is about the wonders of a child's imagination. Only the children can see the creatures and it is almost dream like. But the girls are also dealing with a proper issues, particularly Satsuki who has to act as Mei's guardian and tries to be strong because Mei does not truly understand what's happening to their mum. What surprised me was that My Neighbour Totoro was very grounded, focusing on the girls: I would have liked to have seen more interaction with the creatures, especially because Miyazaki is so great at creating worlds and a great fantasy storytelling.The animation is great, as is expected from a Miyazaki film and there are some very surreal moments. The film is fast paced as hoped for in a children's animated film. But the film is so fast that some things are not explained, like a young boy, Kanta (Toshiyuki Amagasa)'s animosity towards Satsuki. He said that its because that there house is haunted, but surely there was more, maybe he was hurt by Totoro or the house or maybe it is something more basic, like he finds girls inky or fancies Satsuki and he does not know what to do about it.My Neighbour Totoro does have a very sweet nature about it, about how characters interact and the way Totoro and his friends reaction to humans, the small creatures being like normal animals with mystical powers. Totoro is a curious creature who is interested by the children's kindness and the gift of a umbrella, leading to the simple wonders of a big water drops hitting the umbrella. There is also the great Miyazaki trait of silence, letting scenes and actions play out without much sound or dialogue. It plays a universal audience. It was a charming atmosphere.","

"MCMAYNERBERRY","17 May 2009","In 1958, a university professor and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei, move into an old house in rural Japan to be closer to the hospital where his wife is recovering from an illness. The daughters find that the house is inhabited by tiny animated dust creatures called soot sprites—small house spirits seen when moving from light to dark places. When the girls become comfortable in their new house and laugh with their father, the soot spirits leave.While she is playing outside one day, the younger daughter, Mei, sees two white, rabbit-like ears in the grass. She follows the ears under the house where she discovers two small magical creatures, who lead her through a briar patch, and into the hollow of a large Camphor Laurel tree. She meets and befriends a larger version of the same kind of spirit, which identifies itself by a series of roars she interprets as ""Totoro"" (in the Japanese original dub it stems from Mei's mispronunciation of the word for ""troll"", tororu). Her father later tells her that this is the ""keeper of the forest"". My Neighbour Totoro 5/10","

"drqshadow-reviews","29 July 2013","A gorgeous, pitch-perfect example of Studio Ghibli's wonderful trademarked style. Bubbling over with awe, wonder, curiosity and optimism, it's downright impossible not to get sucked into viewing and enjoying this through the eyes of its two young protagonists, recognizing forgotten flashes of our own youth at several steps along the way. The plot isn't particularly deep or elaborate, but in many ways I can see that as a positive - why force drama into a scenario that's working perfectly well as a quiet, leisurely stroll down imagination lane? I was actually relieved when it became clear they weren't even thinking of moving in that direction. Even the more reflective moments don't miss a beat, as Miyazaki and company lovingly flush the screen with life in dozens of cheery, unexpected ways. Magnificent animation pairs with a breathtaking setting, a playful spirit, a lovable cast of characters, great timing and a moderate dash of real-life tangibility. Authentic and vivid and pleasant, with at least one foot planted firmly in our world... despite the constant presence of an eight-foot Furby.","

I wasn't really kept invested throughout the movie, and although I've searched and learned A LOT about it, I have to say. I didn't love it.

"suzunaho","26 June 2006","I like this movie very much. Particularly I love the unique atmosphere in this movie's world. I think all of Miyazaki's films are unique. But this movie is most heart-warming one of his works. I would like to tell you why. First of all the story is almost realistic. In other words, it is about our ordinary life. We can see Japan's typical countryside and an ordinary life whenever we see the film, we feel peaceful. For even those who live in a big city, the movie might have relaxation effects? Second its music and pictures are very enchanting. Maybe almost all the Japanese know ""Sanpo"" -Totoro's theme song- the song is very very famous. It always makes us happy.The pictures are also popular. All characters have tender facial expression. I love their smiles. Everyone like them, don't they? Third, There are many silent without conversation. In such a scene, I can hear the song of birds, sounds of wind. I feel comfortable and calm .It is really Miyazaki's world. This movie will give you gentle, comfortable and calm mind. I can recommend this movie to everyone. Particularly I want to recommend this movie to those who are busy everyday. Maybe this movie makes such people smile.","

"rannynm","27 February 2018","Even after 25 years, My Neighbor Totoro remains an instantly watchable animated masterpiece that holds new surprises from every time I watch it.Satsuki and Mei are sisters who move to the Japanese countryside with their father. The children are fascinated with the quirks of their new house, as well as the vast nature around it. Satsuki goes to school and Mei begins to explore a fantastical world beneath a large tree in the backyard. She meets three little creatures and names one of them Totoro. Mei tells her sister about the adventure, but Satsuki does not believe her. During the next few days, the sisters discover more and more about their neighborhood and adjust to their new way of life.My Neighbor Totoro effortlessly crafts and develops so many different poignant stories. It is a coming-of-age tale, as well as a story about how we deal with change and one about the bond between two siblings. Totoro, his little pals, and the world they inhabit add a whole other layer to an already complete narrative. The magical elements intertwine with Satsuki and Mei's story. They bring light to the siblings, during a scary and dark time in their life. The elements of magic add some levity to less joyful parts of the film, giving just as much closure to the audience as to the characters.The film never reveals too much about Totoro and a lot about him remains a mystery even after the credits roll. He is so adorably drawn and never feels threatening. He has no dialogue, excluding a few grunts here and there, but is still one of my favorite things about this film. He brings a kind of magic that resonates with you every time he is on screen.The lesson of My Neighbor Totoro is to never lose faith in what you believe in. Mei's belief in the magic of Totoro never falters and for that, Totoro helps her and Satsuki not just because they are kind souls, but also because they both learn to believe in his magic.I give My Neighbor Totoro an age rating of 4 to 18. It appeals to all ages and has practically nothing objectionable for young audiences. I think adults will marvel at the spellbinding animation and wonderful story. I give My Neighbor Totoro 5 out of 5 stars and you need to see this special re-release if you haven't already fallen in love with this film.Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

"rannynm","12 February 2018","The anime movie My Neighbor Totoro is cute and funny, yet somehow still realistic. Even though some parts are sad, that adds to the plot and makes the story even better. It starts with two sisters, 4-year-old Mei and 12-year-old Satsuki. When Mei runs off and meets a large, mischievous forest spirit named Totoro, their lives are changed forever. My Neighbor Totoro is directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Every scene is hand-drawn, unlike modern CGI movies. The rural setting and characters just feel real. In one scene, Mei trips and falls instead of running on. This gives a sense of reality, instead of edited perfection.The story starts when Mei, Satsuki and their father move to a new house while their mother is in the hospital. They soon discover that their house is inhabited by forest spirits, such as the soot gremlins. Nearby, Totoro lives in a huge camphor tree and a magical, eight-legged cat bus is a normal mode of transportation for them. After Satsuki and Mei get into an argument, Mei runs away. This part is so heartbreaking! With the help of Totoro...you'll see. The ending is a surprise you'll enjoy!Hayao Miyazaki has also directed other enjoyable anime movies, such as Kiki's Delivery Service and Spirited Away. Recently, Hayao Miyazaki came out of retirement. I, for one, cannot wait to see another Miyazaki directed film!
My Neighbor Totoro is cute, funny and realistic. However, I feel that something is missing. Totoro sounds like the main character, but he is on the screen for only a few scenes. Therefore, the movie somehow seems incomplete. The fact that I want more from it only proves how captivating it is.Overall, My Neighbor Totoro is an amazing movie. In 1988, when this movie came out, anime was not that popular. My Neighbor Totoro set off a craze for anime in the U.S. that has not stopped yet. The special features unravel the magic by describing how the characters were created, the real life inspiration for the movie's unique locations and more.I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 8 to 12. If you enjoy anime, cute and quirky characters, or just a realistic movie, check this out!Reviewed by Eden T., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.","

"zenfroglet","28 May 2004","I cannot believe it took me around 6 years to finally get to watch this film (on an illegally imported Chinese version, no less). This is an amazing piece of animation, characters are so endearing and real, the story so magical, it takes me back to my childhood fantasies (yes I did fantasise about having a large owl/rabbit creature as a friend).I guess some may think of it as a children's cartoon, and children will definitely enjoy it, but adults can enjoy it just as much. I think this is Miyazaki's greatest work alongside the recent Spirited Away. Fantastic works they may be, but with just the right amount of personality mixed in that make them truly human films. I understand this and other Miyazaki's will soon be legitimately available on western shores this summer, a pity with the big name dubbing, but I guess it will make it more accessible to people, and that is good.I totally recommend this to anyone.","

What is even more outstanding is that there is no antagonist in the film at all, and the characters don't have a certain goal that they would follow throughout the film... and it still works properly.The animation is truly fantastic: the whole thing is beautifully drawn and animated, it's all mesmerizing.The direction is simply great: Hayao Miyazaki's talent really shines through.In conclusion, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is an amazingly great movie, a masterpiece of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.","

"kickstand","11 November 2001","My 2.5-year-old is mesmerized by this gentle tale of young children testing their independence and discovering giant animal friends in the forest. The pace is slow and deliberate, and there's nothing overly disturbing, although the mother is in the hospital and the young child gets lost (and found). The theme of secret giant animal friends is compelling and younger children will likely be swept away.","

"pc95","17 February 2010","There really are no ""bad"" Miyazaki movies. And Totoro was the 2nd one of his movies I'd seen, and after seeing most if not all of his movies, this one remains my favorite. It captures childhood innocence and countryside playing immaculately while introducing one of the most recognizable and iconic cartoon characters ever to come from Japan. Totoro is pure enjoyment and fun. From the music to the animation and the beloved Totoro and Neko-Bus, this movie shines and charms. There are so many wonderful scenes and most people will rightfully point to the bus-stop scene as the centerpiece scene - it's my favorite in the movie too no doubt; to add to that I liked the simple countryside story, the settings, background, the noises and sounds and the life depicted. The Japanese voice actors do a fine job as usual too. Totoro is a true classic of animation - as good or better as any Disney or other animation ever crafted, and most likely will remain my particular favorite. Simple, playful, and warm, Totoro will charm like few movies can. Tops - Highly recommended.","

"RainDogJr","1 June 2008","As for many others, I guess, Spirited Away was my introduction to the work of Hayao Miyazaki and as many others, I loved that picture when I saw it on theaters back in the year 2003. Now thanks to my cousin I have seen My Neighbor Totoro on DVD and I can say that is just another gem of Miyazaki.Is a simple but wonderful story about family and the rural Japan is the place for this story. You will be always kind of worry about the two main characters of the story: Satsuki and Mei, two sisters of 10 and 5 years old respectively. Their mother must be at the hospital so they must stay only with their father Tatsuo who works at the University. All of this makes that the girls stay a lot of time alone in a place where getting lost seems very easy but they take care of each other as good sisters. Of course Miyazaki immense imagination is here, of course to help this little girls and when Totoro appears is just fun. I really love this amazing character; sort of a big rabbit that seems always to be very lazy but the magic is here and with the Catbus (another product of Miyazaki's trip) they become soon the adoration and the helpers of the sisters. Is a family movie so is always present the feel of being worried about a family member (the absence of the mother of course but there are many scenes where you can find that feel, for example when it's raining in the bus stop in what probably is my favourite scene) but also that feel of being helped by the people near to you (in this case the people of the village were very kind and really helpful), never loosing the hopes.Conclusion: If you ask me about the animation, I have few words to say: is a piece of work. And if you ask me about the dubbing, well I watched the version of Spain and it's pretty good but I do have desires to watch the film with the original language. Anyway, My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful gem for the whole family (I actually saw this with two of my cousins and with my grandma and the four of us loved the film) and personally after watching my second Miyazaki film I do have a lot of desires to check his entire work. Keep on smoking Hayao!","

"poppy1243","23 July 2004","Tonari no Totoro is a marvelous movie. We can learn a lot about relationships between human life and nature from this movie. Totoro is a forest spirit. When Mei tries to go to hospital that her mother was in, She gets lost. Satsuki is worried about Mei. Totoro kindly helps them. The scene in which the forest spirit helps humans is superb. Totoro also presents a gift to Satsuki and Mei to thank her for her fatherfs umbrella. It was a package wrapped up in bamboo leaves and tied with dragon whiskers. The substance is magic nuts and seeds. I would like to be given the some gift from Totoro. I watch Disney's Lilo and Stitch too. Tonari no Totoro and Lilo and Stitch films are different though they are both family animation. Lilo and Stitch is a more realistic film than Totoro. Stitch is an alien who causes many trouble at every place. And Lilo isn't childlike as Mai. Both at these films are interesting. But, I like Tonari no Totoro better than Lilo and Stitch. Because Tonari no Totoro gives us a lot of dream. For example, a Cat bus which Totoro carry Mei and Satsuki is really impressive. After seeing this movie, I realize we should protect nature in which Totoro can have a happy life. I rated this movie at 9/10.","

"elicopperman","10 November 2018","We all love My Neighbor Totoro, and there's many reasons why. It's an adorable children's film with a lot of heart and soul, it's the first film people conjure up when they think of Studio Ghibli, and it's one of the most recognizable Japanese animated films of all time. Out of all the films by Hayao Miyazaki, this one just might be his most popular, even more than his greatest accomplishments like that of Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. I mean, Totoro is Ghibli's mascot after all. But what does make this film special and worth this much praise for over 30 years?When one gets down to it, this film doesn't really have much of a concrete narrative. The whole film centers around two girls named Satsuki and Mei who move with their father to the countryside to be close to their ill mother, and the rest of the feature is about them embracing the wonders of the forest around them, as well as befriending a giant bunny only they can see. Now from that concept alone, this film could have easily failed, as there's no full on narrative to gravitate towards and we mainly watch the children run around in their home, go to school and hang out with Totoro. However, in execution, it actually works as a visual showcase of childhood wonderment.Apparently, Miyazaki based this film off his own life growing up in post WWI Japan around the ever growing urban development near big cities. Similar to Satsuki and Mei's mother, Miyazaki's mother suffered from tuberculosis, so the depictions of the children's astonishment and activities around their country house feel very much like how any given child would act. In addition, the dynamic between Satsuki and Mei feels very genuine, as even during their biggest arguments, they're no less different than any sibling rivalry that we've all faced growing up. For a film entitled My Neighbor Totoro, the film really is about these two girls' mundane lives, and there's a lot to appreciate about just how peaceful yet alluring their fantasies play out in contrast to their daily lives.That being said, the closest element of the film that resembles a plot is during the third act when Mei runs away to the hospital after hearing that the mother has to stay a little longer. A real sense off drama comes through and yet despite it feeling very emotional, we all know things will be just fine with Totoro around. In fact, this act alone pretty much wrapped up the arch of the girls worrying about their mother, and one can tell Miyazaki really felt proud about this addition given his autobiographical influence that led to this conclusion.There are many different mythological beasts of Japanese folklore, and I think Miyazaki has created a new one for the ages. One of the best scenes in the whole film is centered around our two protagonists waiting for their dad at the bus stop while Totoro waits for a cat bus. Setting aside just how luxurious that cat bus is by both design and motion, there's a real sense of fantastical mystery that comes from seeing such a strange albeit friendly creature that children can gravitate to in becoming one with their surroundings. Overall, My Neighbor Totoro is a genuinely sweet, optimistic and downright admirable family film that reminds us how friendliness can triumph over grimness.","

"emasterslake","6 November 2005","This has been a childhood favorite of mine for a long time. And the first Hayao Miyazaki film I've seen(way before I even knew who he was).This was released in Japan back in 1988 along with ""Grave of the Fireflies"" Came into the USA on VHS back in 1993(owned the Video for more than 10 years) and an upcoming DVD with a new English Debut coming in 2006! The story is taken place in the PostWar Era of Japan. With these 2 girls and their father moving to the Countryside. The girls like the house they've moved to(which is a 2 story home which is bigger than the other homes in the area). They're father is a College Professor. And their mother has a certain illness that had to be treated at this hospital that's in the country. Which is why they moved to the country so they can visit her more often.The 2 girls Satsuki and Mei, are enjoying their new home and the country life. Little do they know is that their neighbor is a big and powerful forest spirit who loves kids.Throughout the movie Totoro will help out Mei and Satsuki when they're in trouble. After you see the movie, you'd feel good about yourself.Unlike other Family Films this one is very special. It has wonderfully done backgrounds, characters, and music. The story is well written too. It's rated G has only one bath scene with the Dad bathing with his 2 girl(there's no mild nudity in that scene just know that in Japan it's completely normal to have a family bath). There aren't any villains or any one too cruel. It's a safe and perfect movie for the whole family to watch.I really recommend this to those who are Anime fans, Miyazaki fans, or even Animation fans.Get the DVD as soon as possible once it's in stores!","

"mergatroid-1","4 November 2011","I've got 4 or 5 Miyazaki movies, and I love them all. Unfortunately I did not find myself quite getting into this one. It really seems for kids, even more than his other movies. I've watched them all multiple times and will watch them again, but I think it'll be a rare night when I pull this out of the collection for a re-view. I suppose I'm happy to have seen it at least once though.This movie doesn't really have much of a story, and if it weren't for Totoro being around, it would be pretty mundane. It picks up a little as Totoro helps the little girl find her sister and then go off to visit her mom in the hospital. If you can get them to sit still long enough, kids should love it because it still has that Miyazaki feel. It just seems like it was made a little more for kids than his other movies were.","

"sharky_55","22 September 2015","The original Japanese audio is imperative to My Neighbour Totoro and I highly recommended it. Not that the English dub isn't sufficient (Ghibli films tend to attract a certain amount of care), but it doesn't do justice the lovely representation of childhood and innocence that the master Miyazaki conjures here. The sisters Satsuki and Mei discover these dust bunnies, little black fluffballs with tiny legs and eyes (this design later revisited in Spirited Away), and they may exist or not, but the adults in their father and Granny certainly indulge them. They delight in this discovery of their 'haunted' house and scream out shrilly and cackle for the bunnies in a way that only the original Japanese can fully justify. And in the animation their eyes grow wide and their grins grow massive - even more massive than say, the arguing men in Castle in the Sky, and that is truly a mark of great emotion when considering Miyazaki's work. That is again revisited in the bathing scene amidst a harrowing storm, where the father ushers in this silliness and over the top laughter to scare away the evil spirits. He's a thoughtful and caring and accommodating character like so few fathers in fiction are today - he isn't the problem, but his career and absence merely a symptom of life. Hisaishi's lovely track ""Obake Yashiki"" (or Haunted House) aids this discovery process; the eager plucks of the synthesizer create such a nervous excitement and curiosity that Satsuki and Mei clutch with their hands and eagerly embrace. I am reminded of this same track being used in this Chinese cartoon from my childhood, about a similarly gigantic tree amongst small trees in peaceful serene forest, until loggers arrive. But within those moments of pure delight in their childhood there is a significant blemish, their mother's illness which continually keeps her in hospital. The film does not focus on her plight as some sort of impending doom, but rather its implications and effects on the rest of the family. It is simply a fact of life. And so Satsuki has been forced into a role older than her years, a motherly comfort for Mei when she sulks and cries. She is, because of the unfortunate circumstances, pushed into the brink of adulthood. So it is the singular Mei who discovers the Totoro creatures, in a very delightful sequence where the white bunny-like one nervously rushes ahead and out of her eager palms. When she indignantly claims that she is not lying about her encounter (after the hilarious incident with the bushes), the adults nod in agreement after initially laughing at her. But Satsuki is also swept up in these tales, because even for her remarkably maturity, she collapses from things asked of her that are beyond what a little girl should be forced to face. And so we have two girls who are devoid of parental attention, and in this they find comfort and serenity in Totoro's adventures, playfully imitating Hisaishi's title theme with recorders atop the gigantic mystical tree.My favourite segment has to be the middle part where the two sisters go to the bus-stop with an umbrella for their father. Miyazaki lets us experience the rain and cold and impatience they feel, but it isn't sinister for no good reason. The giant Totoro joins them, and without a second thought Satsuki offers her the black umbrella, leading to the iconic and strange composition of the pair waiting in the rain for a bus, each with their own way of brandishing the umbrella. And sound design is used so weirdly and wonderful to establish Totoro as a gentle and mysterious giant; the heavy drop of rain that splatters against the umbrella, coupled with the adorable animation of the hairs standing up to attention and the wide lopsided grin. That grin is later copied by perhaps the strangest creature of them all, the cat-bus, with its multiple rapid legs and its pair of rats illuminating its destination. When its door magically widens, we hear a peculiar metallic sound effect, the only ones apart from the sisters to witness this. The magical friendship here is strengthened, though we are still somewhat baffled and amazed. My Neighbour Totoro is an extremely poignant and magical and strange exploration of the sort of childhood curiosity and imagination that children, but in particularly these two, can conjure. They play their recorders atop the giant tree, but it vanishes in the morning. Do they weep and moan? No, they rejoice and dance, imitating the same movements from last night to urge the little seedlings to burst forth once again. It's not the sort of tale that is ramped up to the extremities to promote some internal change - we get an inkling that is already happening with Satsuki, but it's not something that she is entirely ready to handle. And that's okay. Are these forest spirits a coping mechanism, or a fantastic comfort in a world that's a little scarier each time the sisters are told that their mother will not return home quite yet? Many films would have the children approach from a distance, cautious and apprehensive. The father, upon hearing of such a creature, would cynically berate such lies and establish himself as a sort of antagonist, but more importantly as an adult. Miyazaki makes the children squeal in delight and chase after such creatures. The father beats his chest in the most absurd way and cackles madly with his daughters. And later a weeping Satsuki collapses into the chest of Totoro, clearly overwhelmed by the burdens thrust upon her. She finds comfort and assistance. Everything will be okay.","

"rockman182","22 June 2020","Studio Ghibli. How do they keep doing it? This film is so memorable to the point that Totoro is the logo for the studio. Going in order and seeing these films are such an experience because each film is so unique well written and all around beautiful. This is the case with My Neighbor Totoro as well. Just an all around joy to watch and already its one of my favorite from the studio (although this is an unfair assessment because I still have a way to go in completing them all).
The film is about a family that move into a new home. The two daughters get accustomed to their surroundings and interact with the spirits in the house and around them. They befriend an animal like being who resides near them. He is mysterious but friendly and helps in the time of need. He is Totoro. The girl's mother is in the hospital with an illness and her return home is highly anticipated and worrisome for the family. The film is light on plot but its the animation and the experience that makes the film.
I loved the score of this film. I don't know if its the main theme in the film but that piece is wonderful. Much like the rest of Miyazaki's work this film is so vibrant with pristine animation. Miyazaki creates spiritual beings and intricate plot points, like the suswatari in this film. Such an imaginative piece of work. It doesn't have a deep plot like some of the earlier Miyazaki works but even though its simpler and easier to digest its still as imaginative as ever.
This is a film you can watch with family and the little ones if you've got them. I have to say, having an HBO Max subscription has been a real treat being able to really dig into these works and see the creativity on display. I have a feeling when all is said and done My Neighbor Totoro will rank highly among the rest of the studio works. If you haven't seen it, you know what to do.

"GSmith9072","5 June 2007","So simple, so poetic. Two young girls move to the country and discover to helpful furry friends. ""My Neighbor Tortoro"" is a celebration of childhood and imagination and the film is executed brilliantly. The plot is the least of the film's worries. It just goes with the flow, and yet it's fully allowed to. The major conflict in the film doesn't arrive until past the middle, but its odd narrative is more of its subtle beauty. Without to much apparent conflict, we're invited to watch the flashes of fish in the river and uncover odd critters that live in the attic. And so, the magic in the film subtly blends with childhood discovery. There's tadpoles in a puddle, and cute little critters that disappear when chased. There's a big critter with an inviting stomach. The hand painted fluid and organic animation is beyond gorgeous and very appropriate for the earthy flair to this film. Speaking of earth, I find films like these to be the best advocates of environmental protection. We're not padded over the head with anything, but the image of a bottle in a clear lake leaves a strong impact to all viewers. That of course is just another side theme in the film, the importance of nature, and more importantly, it's a non-objectable message. It breaths for me like a painting, and yet the atmosphere is so relaxing and engaging. I don't hesitate to accept the world the little girls create/experience. The messages are those that everyone can relate to. I never grew up Japan (or found any magical creatures that I can remember), but I could certainly identify with the film's two main characters. And if you didn't have a great childhood, sit back and enjoy the adventures of the two eager little girls in this wonderful little film that's also a landmark in animation.","

"jace_the_film_guy","28 December 2023","This movie is warm and magical. Studio Ghibli usually thrives in the outlandish and strange, and this movie only dabbles in both. The story is simple, the characters are relatable and the animation is beautiful (as always).The relationship between the sisters (and their parents) is at the center of the story, which I love. That being said, I wanted more adventures with the titular character. I was hoping for a little more closure in the end, but it is still a fantastic movie. It's a pure comfort film to watch on a rainy day.Best Character: Totoro

"Animany94","13 August 2019","There is just something about the simplicity of the premise of My Neighbour Totoro which makes it such an engaging watch.You see the reality depicted of a couple of sister playing around their house while they are told that they have to move to another place soon. They act just like regular children would when such a message is delivered. That's not the only encounter with reality in the movie, but let me tell you, it's not just material changes, but some serious events handled in such a respectful way without being as heavy handed as the tear-jerkingly sad Grave of the Fireflies released that same year.And as always the animation is just gorgeous with beautiful design of iconic characters, immersive landscapes and grabbing elements of imaginative beings which can be in every child's mind at that young age.A nice feel-good movie with a surprisingly real setting. Not just a mindless kids film, but an animated classic.","

"Blue-Grotto","19 April 2018","It is a dream, and it is not a dream. Two girls, Satsuki and younger sister Mei, move with their father to a country home to be closer to their sick mother. The girls discover a magical realm full of playful, mischievous and child-like spirits. When their mother appears to be in deeper trouble, Satsuki and Mei set off on their own to see what they can do to help.Prepare for deep immersion in Japanese culture, together with its surreal magic, humor and charm! Combine this with the vivid imagination, wit, playfulness and vibrant artistic detail of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and discover a film experience that will transport you to a parallel universe of fantastic sounds, colors and emotions. Enter mysterious forest shrines, dance in the moonlight, listen to the eerie chirp of cicadas and distinct calls from Japanese kites (hawks). See the camphor trees in all their shades, admire the wildflowers and the sky full of stars, and enjoy frequent baths and magical spells. The artistic detail of the animation is amazing to behold, even as early as thirty years ago; light and shadows in multiple layers and forms, reflections and glare in glass, translucent water, drifting clouds, the glow of twilight, astonishing sunrises and sunsets, complex angles of the sunlight, rainfall that mimics the real thing in sight and sound, a rich diversity of dragonflies and butterflies, and even multiple shades to the paint on the wall.Contrary to European culture, a haunted house (a sub-theme of the film) is not necessarily a bad or scary thing. Japanese spirits and demons are good or bad, or more often both, depending on the circumstances. Please listen to the film in Japanese, as the fastidious Miyazaki takes great care to choose the perfect voices. Plus it is rewarding to learn some Japanese (konichiwa! moshi, moshi!) The filmmakers must have spent time observing kids to know and reveal their antics so well. Released by Studio Ghibli at the same time as Grave of Fireflies.","

"dtgp01","22 August 2002","A most excellent animated film.  Gorgeous animation.  A very well written and executed story.  Very true to life, yet with a magical element that also rings true of something bigger than us having concern for our problems. This is the story of two girls and how they deal with the difficulties of moving and having their mom in the hospital for an extended period of time. Help comes from the community around them and from Totoro.  The sense of community really struck me as something that we have lost here in the US.","

"ajs-10","26 December 2011","Another one in my mini Studio Ghibli series. I remember the first time I saw this how blown away I was by the way everything looked so natural. The way people move, the animals and the plants all drawn with such care and attention to detail. Add to that a magical story and you've got what Disney is constantly on the lookout for. Unfortunately (for them) it's a story that I don't think would translate well for the markets they're catering for. But I digress, here is a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts on the matter.Satsuki and Mei have moved house with their father so they can be near their mother who is in hospital. Their new house is in the countryside next to a forest. The girls have great fun exploring and when Satsuki has to go to school Mai goes off on her own. She discovers some magical forest creatures, Totoro's, one of which is of massive proportions! Soon Satsuki sees him too and they have many adventures together. But when Mei gets lost and Satsuki has exhausted every other avenue of help, it's to Totoro that she turns Can he help her find her little sister? Well, I guess I had better not tell you that or the Spoiler Police (Ghibli Division) will be revoking my viewing rights (again).Beautifully animated with great attention to detail, I really love the way this film looks. I watched it in Japanese with subtitles and I didn't mind one bit, it's a really easy plot to follow and so not too taxing on the little grey cells. I will give honourable mentions to the voice talents of; Noriko Hidaka as Satsuki, Chika Sakamoto as Mei, Shigesato Itoi as Tatsuo Kusakabe (the father) and Sumi Shimamoto as Yasuko Kusakabe (the mother).A simple story is the backbone of this film; the magical world of Totoro really makes it a terrific watch. On the downside, I did find the girls voices tended to get a little grating towards the end most of their dialogue seems to be SHOUTED! Apart from that, I found it beautiful to look at with a quite magical tale, not a lot to dislike here Recommended.My score: 8.6/10.IMDb Score: 8.2/10 (based on 47,047 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 90/100 (based on 29 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

While unpacking, the two girls feel that something strange is happening around, to find out later that in the nearby forest lived a supernatural creature by the name of Totoro. This lovely furry cat-like creature will play an important role in their lives, proving to be as helpful as it is cute throughout the movie.It's a very enjoyable movie and although it starts a bit slowly, showing step by step the beginning of the characters' new life, it slowly progresses in thrill and excitement as Totoro shows up. It can't say much about this movie, as it is just a great piece of classic animation, with its unique drawing style! Watching it is a must in order to understand its message.","

"lenii1337","31 December 2013","Childhood is a blossoming period of learning and developing one's own idiosyncrasies. It has always been a sedate stage in which little youngsters define themselves through their senseless antics—ones that appear innocent but are of an elusive nature, and are merely an inadvertent expression of the capricious phase that is childhood. However, since kids are so full of youthful tendencies, very few directors have managed to portray the rascals in a sincere and realistic manner. But among those select few is an irreplaceable Ghibli film which has become a sensation both within its native community and the western world—and that film is Hayao Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro.My Neighbor Totoro is, simply put, a child's imagination brought to life; fanciful tales that become reality, replete with picturesque wonders that reveal the magical and mysterious. Hidden from adult eyes, the otherworldly rewards only those of pure heart. Spirits and mystic guardians of the forest, they embody the creativity and candidness of children—content to experience the simple joys of life and the beauty of nature. With down-to-earth characterization, Satsuki and Mei are splendid lenses into the film's world, their optimism and enthusiasm ensuring every little discovery resonates with the audience—a magical tale that is an adventure for kids, and an opportunity to revisit childhood for adults; a genuine moment of reflection.Although the setting lacks depth, My Neighbor Totoro alleviates this by deftly weaving together fantasy and realism. Very little is explained and detailed, but its integration of the imaginary is both natural and unobtrusive. A big house nestled amidst greenery, uninhabited for decades, a likely home to the mysterious. Satsuki and Mei, true to their age, are explorers of the unknown—their interactions with the rich environment are not only a delight to observe, but also a reflection of the curiosity inherent within every child.Unveiled with mystique, uncanny soot creatures emerge from the house's floor and scamper into the shadows as the heroines enthusiastically tour the dark rooms of their new abode. Even if slightly scared at first, Satsuki and Mei's fear quickly gives way to curiosity, then excitement, and finally delight. The two adventurous sisters stumble upon a new world, and like any child would, wholeheartedly embrace its magic. This very sense of wonder is what leads them to the mythical spirit Totoro, protector and guardian of the forest. Intimidating in size, but gentle in nature, the fuzzy giant embraces the two of them with otherworldly tenderness. In an ever-so-subtle way, he becomes a link between the characters and the forest itself, introducing them to many of its magic wonders.In essence, My Neighbor Totoro is more about inspiring one's imagination—an honest message about the importance of childhood and a connection with nature—than creating a fantasy backdrop. Complexity is absent, but the presentation is delivered with finesse and flair. Much of this is due to the laid-back pace and the amiable guidance of the protagonists, slowly hinting at the mysteries that may be hidden in the nooks and crannies of dark rooms and lush forests. All the viewer needs to do is to sit down, relax, and enjoy the magic unfold.Allowing their daughters the liberty to go and explore the surroundings of their new home, Satsuki and Mei's parents are often absent physically, but present in spirit. As caring guardians, the parents concern themselves with their troublesome daredevils in an earnest and honest fashion. These carefree dynamics connect the otherwise distant adult world with the children's, instilling a sense of trust and intimacy among the family. In this sense, Miyazaki makes a conscious effort of displaying human relationships in a sincere and natural style.True to Ghibli's reputation, My Neighbor Totoro's visuals are masterfully crafted with great attention to even the most minute details. Rich with body language and facial expressions, the screenplay succeeds in the art of showing and not just telling, breathing nuance and realism into the cast's actions and interactions. These subtleties add striking believability to the characters, as adults and children alike look and behave according to their ages. The physical environments, too, are vividly detailed, setting the stage for the integration of the cast and fantasy—be it the cluttered rooms of a house recently moved into, or the green vastness and richness of the countryside.Likewise, the film's sound department is remarkably well-polished. Joe Hisaishi's compositions harmoniously blend with the mood of the scenes—the tempo is upbeat in situations of excitement and discovery, while smooth when tension is low. The timing is delicate, but more than anything, the tracks themselves are what stand out most. Charming and varied, the melodic tunes make extraordinary scenes even more memorable. The careful management not only soothes body and mind, but also permits the soundtrack to lace key scenes with vivid and meaningful tonality. Interesting to note, though, is that for most of the movie, there is no background music. Instead, focus is placed on environmental sounds, allowing the countryside setting to weave its own atmosphere. In concordance with the naturalistic tone of the story, this adds a more organic touch to the presentation—one focused on painting nature in its purest form.A tale intended for kids, yet a journey fit for audiences of all ages, My Neighbor Totoro is a splendid story that encapsulates the beauty of childhood. The film's wonderful portrayal of Satsuki and Mei's imagination conveys a true sense of jollity present in most children. Beyond its realism, the film delivers a dazzlingly magical experience by way of its supernatural encounters with the manifestations of nature. But this occurs ever so gently, that one could consider it a dream-like tale that both begins and ends in blissful serenity. A true classic, My Neighbor Totoro will remain in the hearts of many as a heartwarming experience of one of the purest and most beautiful memories: a frolicsome childhood, never to be forgotten.","

"Proudtoberandom","30 July 2014","With all the crude humor, fantasy violence, and bad jokes in recent kids films, it's nice to see one that has none of that. This is a sweet movie, with no violence and little scariness, and manages to (get this) be funny without people farting! Whaaaat?? Yes, it's possible! All the characters, even the ghostly soot sprites, are adorable and lively, and the whole movie gives off a magical vibe that other kids movies just don't. Totoro is literally the cutest thing I have ever seen, and the Bus Stop Scene is a must-see moment. Every scene is great! Whether you're 8, 18, or 48, you'll love this movie no matter what, with its adorable animations, wonderfully developed characters, and heartwarming conclusion, you'll be with this film from start to finish, and definitely want to see it again! It's cute, hilarious, and non-obnoxious. A great film!!","

"AhmedSpielberg99","5 June 2018","I can't describe how delighted am I after I've just finished watching this movie. This is the best movie that captured the childhood very accurately. The children characters behave so realistically that I couldn't believe my eyes while watching them play, cry, laugh, or doing anything. I didn't felt like I was watching a child in front of me, but I felt like I was watching my younger self; I felt like I was watching myself as a child, or as if my childhood memories were being displayed before me. Even if I haven't done that particular thing the characters do, I somehow felt that my younger self would do the exact thing. If that means anything, it's that Hayao Miyazaki has captured The essence of childhood like now one did.But the greatest thing about My Neighbor Totoro isn't how realistic it feels, but it's the fabulous message it delivers, and the thing that is more fascinating is the way it delivers this message. I really shouldn't spoil anything about this gorgeous film, but it delivers a message about facing the fear; the fear of everything, and the fear in all its kinds and levels. Miyazaki merged this message with the story in a gleefully brilliant way.I shouldn't call it delivering the message, though. Instead, I should call it merging or combining the message with the story, or rather I should say that Miyazaki created an entire story from a message! It's really amazing that this film has no real plot!Hayao Miyazaki proved that it's not even necessary for a movie to have an antagonist, or at least not a common one, as I mentioned above, the story itself is about a message about facing the fear. And I didn't feel at any time throughout the movie that I need an antagonist or a usual problem to be invested in the movie. I was engaged and hooked from the very beginning of the movie till the end credits scene, which is very cool, by the way.The thing is that at the third act the movie changed completely in terms of the plot; it turned from a plot-free movie to a movie that has a real plot and a very serious problem. The plot and its problem didn't come from nowhere; they are attached very well to the story from its beginning, and it's been appeared later that the plot is kinda share the same message of the story, but the problem is that the movie changed a great deal when it moved from its second to the third act. I felt as the movie betrayed itself after promising, and spectacularly managing to keep the audience on the edge of their seat with a story devoid from typical plot issues and obstacles. Yes, I've been engaged again and invested in the story with its plot because I cared about every single character, but it took me a little time, and I really felt a bit uncomfortable and annoyed with this inconsistency.Overall, I can say that My Neighbor Totoro is an imaginative tale that every parent should enjoy it with his/her child. Because I think that the moral of the story is actually as, if not more important to parents.I personally prefer My Neighbor Totoro to Spirited Away, but if I'm going to be honest with myself, Spirited Away is the better film; just slightly better. Looking forward to see more works from this genius filmmaker.(8.5/10)","

"EdwardtheBlackPrince","3 March 2021","My Neighbor Totoro is studio Ghibli third film and third directed by Hayao Miyazaki. The film tells the story of two sisters Satsuki &Mei who moved into a old Rundown house with their father so that they can be closer to their mother who is at a nearby hospital. Everything seems normal at first until one day mei see small creatures walking pass her like she won't notice it. After following them she comes across a creature known as Totoro a dragon cat spirit of some sort.over the course of the movie Satsuki and mei meet up with Totoro and go on adventures and play games with one another. The Choice of scenery was a good decision to be made taken place or out in the country country side as opposed to the city where it's less distractions. The story keeps the focus on the girls and both are a silly and over the top happy. It's also nice where usually the mother is in a supporting role for the kids instead it's the father who at no point belittles their imagination even though it is real he just goes along and sarcastically agrees with them that ah yes there are spirits their all around us"" Or ""of course dear I believe you totoro is real"". He supports the girls in this time of need with what's going on with her mother. The biggest pro with some cons of the movie is none other then Totoro himself. I'm not disrespecting or Belittling Totoro and what he has to offer to the film it goes without saying how popular this character is given that he's the official mascot of the studio. Totoro does serve his purpose in keeping the girls happy and coping with their mothers condition he takes them for rides & flying. I personally felt that there wasn't enough scenes of them interacting when you get down to it apart from the Occasional shenanigans Totoro doesn't do much for lots of the time but sleep. Overall my neighbor Totoro is a fun loving film for all ages and a high recommendation to fans Of beautiful artwork and colors pallets.","

"mstanger-99388","20 December 2018","Ever since my mom brought home the Chinese edition of ""My Neighbor Totoro"" way back in 2003, it's been on my top ten list of films. And while I haven't lived out in the East Asian countryside nor have I had my mother become seriously ill, the family dynamic of two young girls and their father can always take me back to being a little kid again.One of my favorite scenes has to be when Mei goes missing. Satsuki and
Nanny are heard calling out for her over scenes of fields as the sun sets. First of all, beautiful scenery, but it always makes me nervous when Satsuki calls Mei's name out once more in hope only to be recieved by the loud, static buzz of cicadas. The barren and empty atmosphere certainly gives me the chills. It almost reminds me of getting lost when I was that age.One of the best features of Miyazaki films is simply the pure piece of artwork it is, and it certainly doesn't falter here. Each animated figure is vividly colored, expressive, and detailed. It's almost a style where you could stop at any moment in the movie and take apart the details of Satsuki's facial expressions or the condition of Mei's clothes and figure out what is happening. Even better are the painted backgrounds of rice paddies that never cease to remind me of Van Gogh paintings or the spiritual forests, and creepy old houses. Every fine brushstroke adds more meaning and cultural significance to the plot, such as the protective spirit statues behind the bus stop in the woods just before Totoro shows up to wait for the Catbus.Another great feature apparent in this film, and really of his films, is the shear originality of it. I'll be honest, I haven't seen a thing like it. The combination of East Asian mythology and Miyazaki's creativity make all his productions stand out from your typical animations. There's nothing quite so heart-warming as two little kids befriending the big and fuzzy spirit of the forest named Totoro. The plot and content is also innocent and folk-based unlike many animations. It's great in that it allows you to more closely see the values and morals of different cultures without all the hyped fuss. Truly a great movie for all people of all ages.","

In fact, this is, perhaps, Miyazaki's sweetest movie ever, as it is captures the essence of being a child, with the innocence, naughtiness and magic that surround it. We see the simple things that make children happy: playing with little things, imagining things, the thrill of moving to a new place and making new friends, siblings' relationships of dependence, love and hatred, and the magic that innocence can create. Anybody can remember special moments of his/her childhood when watching this movie.Much of the appeal of the film are the characters of the two little girls and their neighbor old ""grandma nanny"" to whom the viewer feels immediately drawn, but also to the quirky plush-ish characters of Totoro and friends. The dubbing of the actors in the Japanese version is excellent and really honors the characters and makes them even more adorable.Not less important in the movie, is the fantastic drawing of the Japanese scenery, so beautiful and emotionally connected to the story. The landscape, and Nature, play an important part in the movie, and, as in other Miyaki's films, the themes of the magic in Nature and the power of being in harmony with the environment are also explored here.A delightful movie for children and animation lovers in general.","

"Rickting","24 November 2014","I've seen 4 Studio Ghibli films now (This, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke and The Wind Rises) and they are miles ahead of DreamWorks and nearly every other animated studio. Their films are just as visually stunning as the CGI ones and uniquely magical. My Neighbour Totoro is another enchanting film about 2 girls making friends with the forest spirits and having various adventures. MNT is widely regarded as one of the best animated movies ever and it should be. It's not as good as the other Ghibli films I've seen. It's very short and there's not that much of a plot. Therefore, it feels slighter and briefer than the others. There is a slight lack of structure. Those shortcomings demote it from a five star movie to a four star one, but there's plenty to love about this movie. The visuals are great and there is a real sense of wonder and amazement. It's colourful, dazzling and the anime looks just as realistic as Pixar's animation does. Hayao Miyazaki is pretty much the current ruler of animation, and only Walt Disney can rival him in the animated world.MNT is a very soulful and sweet movie that feels genuinely magical and enchanting. Various scenes such as the bus stop and the cat bus are awe inspiring and wondrous, and the script has plenty of sentiment but feels genuine and charming. This is a film where only the most cynical and hardened film viewers will dislike it, as the film has likability and charm in spades. This children's film lacks what many children's films are sorely lacking: A sense of innocence and elegance. It may not be the best movie by Studio Ghibli but it has some of the most memorable moments from their filmography and some of their best images. The forest spirits are beautifully designed and there's good reason why a Totoro toy appears in Toy Story 3. This is a more relaxed picture from Miyazaki and while his other movies have their frightening bits this is pretty much devoid of them. A delightful animated movie with plenty of sparkle and dazzle. Younger audiences will be enthralled, but it'll speak to adults as well.8/10","

"davimaciel-34563","3 February 2024","The movie is beautiful. Very aesthetic pleasing scenarios and I really liked the water. The music is also good. It is a very light hearted and upbeat story I need to say, full of cute moments. But that is basically it. There was no character development and no history build up. The movie also don't bother saying much about the origins or meaning of Totoro and the other creatures. Maybe I just don't know enough about Japanese culture to understand, or I just did not get it. The climax is not very interesting. I think I would enjoy the movie much more as a very young kid, but not now as a grown-up.","

"claszdsburrogato","9 February 2023","My Neighbor Totoro is not a story that needs enormous emotional depth to develop its narrative. Unlike animations like those from Pixar, here the drama is very little explored. In fact, it only truly occurs at the end. Even so, the narrative is not sustained only with emotional moments. There are moments where the viewer can actually feel emotional, but the film as a whole keeps our hearts warm because it is a happy and innocent comedy. The film seeks to explore the purity of childhood. The characters are perfect representations. The happiness they feel over small events is beautiful and relatable. The fantasy is very well introduced and manages to convey a very pure love. My Neighbor Totoro is an excellent animation.","

"MattBrady099","12 December 2014","This is going to be the strangers and the most weirdest thing I'm about to say but I wish Totoro was real so I can sleep one it's fury tummy, it just looks so comfortable.The story is about two young girls who find that their new country home is in a mystical forest inhabited by a menagerie of mystical creatures called Totoros. They befriend O Totoro, the biggest and eldest Totoro, who is also the king of the forest. As their girls' mother lies sick in the hospital, O Totoro brings the sisters on a magical adventure but also helps them to understand the realities of life. My Neighbor Totoro (or Tonari no Totoro ) is a anime film with: No scary monsters, no villains, no evil adults and not like the other three act structure, and that could surprise a lot of people who are expecting the same third act in animated movie. This movie was beyond loved for being the best animated film ever made and that's from die hard fans of Hayao Miyazaki and moviegoers everywhere, and I can see easily see why, because this movie in opinion is one of the most griping, beautiful and the most stunning anime that actually give me butterflies deep inside of movie, and that's rare for me.This may sound over the top or over doing it but I don't Hayao Miyazaki is a god of anime and storytelling to the big screen. I only seen some of Miyzaki films but after watching spirited Away and this movie I want to more of this guys work, I found out that Hayao Miyazaki last film was The Wind Rises which I need to watch sooner or late, but it's a same to hear that, but the good things must come to a end. I absolutely loved the animation in this film, I mean how can put it into words without messing up my words. It's better to watch and experience the creative animation standing out from any other animated films, and just let the wonderful character's that are fully of joy and life can easily win you over by the first sentence.For problems... I don't have any, yeah no problems with this film. I was glued in by the world that Miyazaki created. I was locked in from start till the very end.Overall My Neighbor Totoro is different and the film doesn't shy away from that, it's a brilliant film and it's more then a kids film even adults can dig this movie.","

"phillyX","18 May 2004","when i first started watching this movie i had some insecure thoughts about actually wanting to watch it mainly because it seemed too *cute and childish* for a person my age(20)...i cant express how glad i am that i didn't follow through with those thoughts... cuz this movie is pure emotional bliss from the moment it starts and it keeps ur attention all the way to the end...VERY rarely can a movie and its characters manage to make u feel what they feelwhen the 2 sisters are excited, YOU become excited... when they are scared, YOU become scared... when they are happy, YOU become happy...the only thing that bothered me is that it was too short... i cant recall the last time 86 mins went by so fast!!the only thing i can blame myself for is that i haven't watched it until now, 16 yrs after it was made... to everybody else...don't make the same mistake i did... get it any way u can (ive only watched the japanese version cuz if u ask me English is pure poison to anything japanese/asian)10/10","

"mehobulls","18 October 2020","Art can have this amazing way of showing life more vividly than mundane reality, and ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is a prime example, taking us back to a view the world through children's eyes. More specifically, it is Japan, capturing its magical landscapes of rice fields and blue skies, the friendly, polite culture, its foods, architecture and customs that make it so very unique. A quintessential film.","

"wiemerscarson","29 October 2020","Like most of the studio ghibli movies, the story telling in this train wreck is awful. In almost every one of these movies I have seen the writers forgot to introduce a plot. There are random short lasting conflicts throughout that do not even connect at the end. If you watch 30 minutes into this movie and I asked you ""what is this movie about?"" You would not be able to answer. There is a lot of story and absolutely no plot making for a long and boring disaster. I do not recommend this movie unless your the type of person who can enjoy a movie just because their are cute things in it. If you are that type of person, first of all good for you. Secondly you will love this movie.","

"rooee","12 April 2010","In 1988, after the delightful Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984) and Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), Hayao Miyazaki turned his attention to an even younger audience for this sugar-sweet fairy tale charting the adventures of the two young girls, Satsuki (Noriko Hidaka) and Mei (Chika Sakamoto), who move to the countryside with their university professor father (Shigesato Itoi) to be near the hospital where their mother (Sumi Shimamoto) recovers from a nameless illness.It is narrower of scope than the aforementioned classics - deliberately so, because this is a essentially a small-scale drama about a family coping with a terminal illness. That sounds dreadfully morose for what is a work aimed at very young children, but it's all played out very cheerfully, as we gradually enter the kids' fantastical world. In this world they meet the sleepy troll called Totoro. Their passion gives him a reason to awaken, and he becomes the totem of strength and vitality the girls need to cope with the uncertainty surrounding their mother's condition.We often speak of Pixar's and Dreamworks' canniness with the subtle grown-up substance of their animations. But Miyazaki goes beyond winks and trivial references. Perhaps it is the simplicity of his refreshingly formless narrative, but his symbolism has never been stronger than here. At one point, Mei becomes disillusioned by the fact that her acorns will not grow. Then, one night, she and Satsuki meet Totoro and perform a strange rain dance. The acorns don't just grow - an oak tree explodes from the earth, growing a hundred feet high in seconds. It's just one of many beautiful, hopeful scenes, all of which are delivered with a delirious smile.There is more than one nod to Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland: Mei enter's Totoro's realm through a mazy, rabbit hole-style tunnel, while the hilarious 'Catbus' bears the perennial grin of the Cheshire Cat. But parents should not worry about any lurid drug references - this is a film that relishes the trappings of innocence better than any other I've seen.","

"Jeff-154","20 March 1999","This is one of the best movies for kids and their parents I've ever seen. It's a cartoon fantasy that won't insult the intelligence of grownups.  The kids portrayed in the the movie are refreshingly like real-life children, not little comedians who crack snappy one-liners at each other.  The adults are caring and compassionate toward the kids.  Best of all, the natural world is depicted with loving attention to detail that makes it as magical as the Totoro spirits who inhabit it.  By all means see this film!","

"AnonymousbutDilpreet002","22 July 2018","This film is not only for kids . Infact , I don't recommend it to anyone below 13 . Most of the cartoons movies have a simple single plot. This one has two major plots and some sub plots too. I think it's a little complex for a children film.There is a scene where a father and his two daughters bath together which not okay for such a film. Maybe it's a culture in Japan but it can be disturbing for foreign viewers. Furthermore, there is a subplot of a love story between two kids. I admit that cartoons(And Animes) are also for adults but still this is a little too much for animation film.This is case with other Miyazaki films .Coming to the story , it starts with tatsuo kusakabe buying an old house . He lives with his daughters satsuki and Mei while his wife is sick and is in a hospital. Satsuki and Mei discovers that the house is haunted . They soon meet forest spirits and befriends them . First 50 minutes are wonderfully entertaining . It's a highly imaginative film. The bizarreness of the storyline keeps us engaged for entire 50 minutes. But after that the story goes downhill . It becomes confusing . The repetitive incidents fails to entertain . It drags for another thirty minutes.It does not have much of a storyline . It's a combination of sub-plots with a high amount of imagination which is best suited for kids . Miyazaki has a wide understanding about children's mind . More than any of us. But as I said earlier , its little too much complex . The idea of mother's death is dark for a children film.","

"deexsocalygal","18 May 2021","Ponyo is way better than this. I was a little disappointed. It starts out really good with two little girls moving into a new house in the country. I liked how the kids ran excitedly through their new house together exploring all the rooms & also meeting their neighbors. The big sister is always there for her little sister. It's interesting seeing how the Japanese live & the style of their kitchens, bathrooms, & bedrooms differ from American houses. The parts I didn't like so much was when Totoro makes his appearances. The 1st time the little girl runs into Totoro while she's playing outside by herself while her older sister is at school. Totoro is borrring. He's a very dull character. She runs into him while he's asleep in his cave. He did nothing but sleep, snore, & say his name in some kind of horrible growling screaming way while opening his huge mouth & baring his teeth. You can barely recognize that he's saying ""Totoro"". It was freaky. The next time Totoro makes an appearance is when the two girls are waiting in the rain by themselves at a bus stop for their father's bus to come bringing him home from work. The little girl is tired & cannot stay awake anymore. There's no bench & the ground is wet so the older sister has to carry her. Totoro didn't do anything- just walks up & stands next to her at the bus stop. He just stands there silent. The older girl stares at him wide eyed & gives him an umbrella. Instead of something cute happening Totoro decides to use his magic to shake the rain drops down on top of them from leaves of the tall trees. Besides the normal rain, now they have to endure bigger drops pelting down on them really hard from the trees & they make a very loud sound as they hit their umbrellas. It seemed like a mean scary thing to do. Totoro should of tried to make the girls feel more comfortable while they're outside alone in the rain waiting for their father. The girls are worried because his bus is late. The little girl is so tired she can't stand up anymore. There's no bench to sit on while they wait for their father so the big sister had to carry her & an umbrella. Totoro shows up & you would think he would do something to make her feel at ease. Instead he makes it rain harder. Then an odd bus shows up in the shape of a cat & Totoro gets on it & without saying a word the cat bus takes off & the two girls are all alone again. Stupid. So, outside of Totoro I liked the movie but that isn't good because the name of the movie is Totoro. For the main character Totoro isn't very exciting, cute, or kid friendly.","

"moutelik","11 April 2002","This is a masterpiece. Some films bring us unforgettable scenes. This is one of them. There is one scene, where the Totoros dance around a flower bed, where the girls had planted some accord seeds. The girls join the Totoros, in this childish dance to make the seeds sprout. To me as an adult, this was such an enchanting scene. To my children (3 and 4 years) it was magic, as we danced like the Totoros. The kids loved it, even not speaking English. I'd like to add a small detail, that can be seen on the DVD: the japanese version is full of silent scenes. In the dubbed version, those silences are almost always filled with some background dialogue. It doesn't spoil the dubbed version, but makes an interesting cultural detail.","

"jose-cruz53","29 September 2012","My Neighbor Totoro is in my honest opinion one of the best movies I ever had the chance to see. It's absolutely perfect in every respect: the soundtrack is simple and beautiful, the animation is of excellent quality, with beautiful painting landscapes, the characters are amazingly realistic and is perhaps the ultimate children's movie. It's a flawless diamond of cinema and was rightly included among the 250 greatest movies ever made list by Sign and Sound.One day I watched this movie together with Citizen Kane and Akira and it easily ""overpowered"" both of these films (in terms of engaging my emotions). It's much more humane and engaging than 99.9% of all other films, animated or otherwise. The film also flows seamlessly and makes you pay attention without any effort, something that most movies have difficulty in attaining (a particularly extreme example would be Citizen Kane).This movie is considered to be Miyzaki's most personal film, as it reflects his childhood in Japan of the 1950′s. Though I don't really care that much about how personal a film is to a director besides it's effect on the emotions produced by the film. Other Miyazaki films also had a very strong emotional effect without any personal connection with the director, for instance, Kiki's Delivery Service takes place in an alternate history European city and it is about equal to Totoro in my book.I have argued previously that Miyazaki films (as other Studio Ghibli films) are extremely aggressive. Indeed, this film is like being hit in the head repeatedly by a 10-ton stone made of pure cuteness over a period of 90 minutes: every minute of the film consists of scenes evoking these strong emotions, structured around a simple basic story to minimize noise and we can really fell like the protagonists during the course of the film, it reveals the inner child of anyone. A masterpiece of simplicity and yes, cinematic aggressiveness.","

This film though, is his first certified masterpiece. I love everything. The music is fantastic, the characters are loveable, so damn loveable and the animation is beautiful. The designs of the spirits as well are just next level.The story is delightful, it balances genuine heartbreak, the mother's illness, Mei's disappearance, (I will admit I was close to tearing up at points), with moments of pure ecstasy, the journey on the cat bus and tree growing. It has a really tight run time, a simple cohesive plot. There is nothing that comes to mind for me to criticise.It's so close to reaching a 9, so close but I don't quite think it gets there. Still a fantastic film.","

"akash_sebastian","21 July 2012","As we all know, Hayao Miyazaki is a master story-teller and animation director. This movie is one of his earlier gems, released back in 1988.With a warm & friendly story, and interesting characters & situations, the visually arresting movie takes us on a joy ride. No Villains, No Songs, No Adult humour - Just a simple adventurous journey of two sisters. The human characters are so real, lively and sincere. Their interaction with the warm and likable fantasy characters is enjoyable. A person of any age and taste can enjoy the movie. It delights you, without being crude or vulgar.Trivia: The movie is slightly autobiographical. When Miyazaki and his brothers were children, his mother suffered from spinal tuberculosis for nine years, and spent much of her time hospitalized. It is implied, yet never revealed in the film, that Satsuki and Mei's mother also suffers from tuberculosis. He once said the film would have been too painful for him to make if the two protagonists were boys instead of girls.","

As a person who does not watch anime regularly, this is amazing. My only real judgement of it Is that fact that basically it's more centred on the two little girls rather than totaro. And it also can be very very boring at times, otherwise I suggest this movie to anyone.","

And the attention for random details (like a toad in the rain) makes it so charming.What Miyazki does so much better than western animated family movies is to make the character real with flaws and imperfections. Which makes it a pleasant and surprising watch for everyone.Make sure to watch the first 30min your under 12y/o kids as it starts a bit exciting with some suspense. It will be hard to find many people that would truly dislike this movie. Don't read further watch and enjoy ;-)","

""As long as there are Doudou dragons in everyone's heart, childhood will never disappear, and love is the most beautiful possession."" These originally touched me The lyrics still have this charm. The foolish attachment of Houhou seemed to be back in my body, which delighted me.The two little girls are really cute, Xiaoyue is the elder sister, and Xiaomei is the younger sister. They are lively and cheerful, and they all have the enviable childhood, such as innocence, innocence and kindness. My sister is more sensible, and my sister is still a little childish. When I saw them chasing and playing, I saw my sister following her like a little bug, and always shouted: ""Sister, wait for me!"" I can't help smiling . In addition, they happily have a pair of good parents, because they also maintain their innocence, although they can no longer see Totoro.Totoro is also really cute, although its cry is a little scary, and its smile is a bit ""strange."" But when it took the umbrella and was a little overwhelmed because it would not be used, we all understood its kindness. Then it ""roared"" to its own bus-a big cat with a more weird smile, and left happily, very complacent. Later, this cat car sent the sisters to her mother's hospital, and learned that her mother did not cause any bad news. So the world of the sisters changed from heavy rain to sunny day, and the smile slipped out of my mouth again.There is also an equally cute little boy who, although a little timid, is so shy and cute that he ca n't help but endure. He has a crush on Xiaoyue, so he silently helps her and makes viewers feel warm.Not a heart-breaking tragedy, but the most life-like narrative touched the numb mind. I am deeply in love with this cartoon, not for anything else, just for the childlike innocence that I have lost. Can I still see Totoro?""The world has everything, as long as you are willing to feel it.""","

"manendra-lodhi","4 August 2012","Each film from studio Ghibli has something which cannot be seen normally in other animation films. It's like they treat you in such a gentle way that you cannot hate their films. This film is again a best example of love and innocence at its best. What we have been provided with again is another visual treat of imaginations.The film has two major characters in the form of cute little girls who are enjoying their days as much as they can. They move to a so called haunted house and their adventures take new turns when they meet little creatures. The little girl is so adorable that you simply cannot take your eyes off her.Pros: When you will finish watching the film you will kind of feel happy cause like many other ghibli films this one also has positive attitude as the nature of people projected is a gentle and kind. The film progresses slowly and manages to keep you interested because of the adorable faces of the two major characters. After the halftime the story takes huge leaps of imaginations and you are now completely into the film. Sometimes you want to laugh, cry, get mad and all those emotions are aroused in this show of the film. Cons: Nothing as such but sometimes I feel that by showing us cute little faces and their innocence, aren't they enjoying the benefit of kindness?MESSAGE: ""Never forget the simple pleasures of life.""VERDICT: ""Highly recommended for all animation lovers.""","

"Aoi_kdr","6 July 2019","In spite of a blockbuster, studio Ghibli doesn't make the sequel of this movie. I couldn't forget that reason Mamoru Oshii talked about. It is jusw that Hayao Miyazaki never wants to put Totoro on the commercial basis as a character. Then I felt his love for his own works so much.Today, Japanese tend to admire living in an old house in a country have been increasing. I wondered if physiolatry was engraved in their genes.","

Especially during the ending, it felt kind of weird. I really just didn't like the dialogue regarding Mother's illness, because it kind of implies that Satsuki was lied to about it just being a cold, then it's just like ""yup, it's just a cold and she got another one before she was about to leave."" It feels super weird and detracts from the ending imo.","

"ShenLong","19 March 1999","Tonari no Totoro holds a special place among all the animated movies I had ever watched as the movie that makes me remember what's it like to be a child again. Totoro reminds us what it feels to see the world around us as a child, where everything is new, fresh, and exciting.  This movie also contains some of the best scenes ever created in an Anime.  There is a lot of HEART in this movie.  It is also clear that rather than designing the visuals for the sake of merely making them look pretty/ appealing, the designers uses their sensitivity to convey how interesting the world looks from their point of view.  This results in a movie that connects to the audience in so many ways.  This movie certainly has the charm and ""magic"" that had been lost in so many recent animated features. I highly recommend this movie.","

"Atavisten","27 May 2005","The respectively 4 and 8 year old Mei and Satsuki move with their father to the countryside of Saitama while the mother is in hospital. They find out that they live nearby a giant totoro.Its so great to see that this type of anime gets recognition in the west in the flood of violent ones. This is peaceful, humane and depicts real people instead of the Disney variety of sugarcoated tales. Hayao Miyazaki has made some terrific anime for kids that would not offend a grown up either. I discovered it just a few years ago and I thoroughly enjoy 'Future Boy Conan' and 'Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi' for instance.This is also nice, the imagination to come up with nekobus (cat-bus) and the totoro is childlike in a good way. It doesn't have a real story to tell however and that takes it a bit down.And to bathe with your children help give them a natural relationship with their bodies when they grow up and if thats offensive to you, stick with Disney.","

"kurosawakira","1 June 2014","Similar to ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" (2001) in premise and ""El espíritu de la colmena"" (1973) in its depiction of childhood imagination, Miyazaki's ""Tonari no Totoro"" (1988) succeeds in blending the Japanese folklore and warm childhood summer nostalgia, the unattainable freedom of youthful imagination and hope, and the fear of not only growing up but becoming overwhelmed by the worldly sorrows of the grown-ups.Full of the small, beautiful moments of family life: the bath, the bicycle ride (the dad resting in the grass while the girls eat), the possibility of the mother's death frames a deeply moving story of two children at a loss as to how to cope with the illness and absence of their mother. And they've also just moved house, as Sen had before going through the tunnel, which in this film leads further into the forest, to the magnificent Caphor tree.A great deal is made of that which exists but cannot be seen by the adults. The Susuwatari, the rustle of wind that in fact is something much more than mere wind, the rain that hides more on the darkening nightly road than an ordinary bus, the planted seeds that magically grow overnight; all this leads to the final emotional resolve, where the girls deliver an ear of corn on the windowsill of their mother's hospital room. In a sense, the whole film is all about this trip the children make, where the film tries to convince us that in that ear of corn not everything is as it seems.","

"Rosser94","22 March 2012","I'd firstly like to say that I am a HUGE fan of the movies created by Studio Ghibli; they are unlike anything else and this is the case for all of the right reasons.However, I was somewhat disappointed with ""My Neighbour Totoro"" as, although the charm and imagination of Ghibli productions is there, the actual story-telling techniques seem inadequate for such a great studio. In terms of the positives of this movie, it has the cute, crazy, original and adventurous style that fans of Japanese anime and especially Studio Ghibli will know and love. In addition to this, the story is one that will probably put a smile on your face at various points. Furthermore, the characters are, for the majority of the movie's run-time, very likable.However, whilst the style that Ghibli is famous for makes this film a good one, the actual film-making is just not up to the same standard as some of Hayao Miyazaki's other productions, such as Spirited Away and The Castle of Cagliostro. Firstly, some of the characters are introduced in a manner suggestive of a depth to them, however this complexity is never really provided in some cases. We are, essentially, made to want to know more about some characters (their motives, origins, thoughts), however this thirst for knowledge is not entirely satisfied. This limited feel to the movie is furthered by the fact that the whole plot seems slightly too trivial and lacks a driving purpose. Finally, considering the fact that the run-time is around 80minutes, the pacing is quite peculiar, which left, me personally, wanting more to happen quickly, however this desire is never really met.Overall, this is, undoubtedly, a very good film, and worth a watch for any fans of Japanese anime. However, underneath the wonderful style, originality and creativity Studio Ghibli invoke, is a fairly shallow production that relies far more on its charm as opposed to its production values.","

After I watched this film I wished that all movies were rated G and contained the magic that Miyazaki captured when he made this film.

Of course Totoro himself is an icon and adorably designed, but the core of the story is all about the sisters. The whole family rides on positive vibes and energy. The dad does a lot to make sure the kids feel happy and comfortable given the situation. But that still doesn't stop the kids from feeling sad about missing their mom. Totoro was a friendly spirit that appeared to the kids when he was needed most and gave them the happy, magical adventure thy deserved.","

"miaalike","22 February 2021","The movie is not just for children. All of us, if at least a bit fortunate to have had a childhood free of superimposed adult perspective, can relate to it. The images and events from the movie are like seen through the eyes of a child. A moderately happy child, not the utopil ultimately carefree one, nor the unhappy one that is dragged into adult problems in a way that ruins childhood. Two sisters take up a summer residence in the countryside with their father, to be closer to their mother who is temporarily in hospital. That is the framework story. On this framework we get to experience beautiful moments in the time spent close to nature, especially by the main character, the big sister. These moments cross into a magical realm, as it often happens with children. The story is like a suite of small poems, haikus if you like to call them so. Once you resonate with the movie, these poems will stay with you forever. The music is also great, matches the atmosphere. And there is that feeling that when watching this movie, you remember dreamily bits and bobs from your own early childhood, otherwise lost under layers and layers of adulthood. Because the movie captures the feel of those moments. No idea how children perceive the movie, however it is family friendly and might provide a watercoloury, nice, story for any child, along with an important message that nature is a warm, kind and spirit-filled entity that loves us all and expects the same from us.","

"nathanielqwilson","26 August 2018","For me, the worst movie of its writer and of its studio but then again, I always preferred Fireflies to Mononoke.The issue of this movie is simple. It doesn't have any conflict. This is the thing that is at the centre of all storytelling. I want to be fair and try to understand what this movie was trying to do. It was not meant to be the resolving antagonism between two forces, but rather a meditation on the good things in life, not the bad. In that respect it isn't badly made. It is a breezy and soothing trek quite perfect for someone recovering in hospital after an emotionally and physically traumatizing experience.In other movies, one of the little girls would feel spiteful about having to move home or there would be some other type of family disharmony. But here the worst thing going on with these people is the sick mother but even then, we only see her in a convalescent state.Totoro himself barely does anything but I don't want to reveal too much.
I have exaggerated a little, the movie does try to bring a little conflict for the climax, but it is as contrived and out of the blue as the final act of ""Twilight"". But in ""Twilight's"" defence, they used their climax to explore themes present throughout the book and they are only part one of the ""Twilight Saga"".
It has a professional, verdant design and many instantly icon moments that unfortunately are wasted in having no real context, but they did make me want to like it. It's the five-year-old's birthday party soundtrack that makes me want to dislike it.I can see myself at 5 being tolerant of this movie even if you have to wait through all the slice of life to get anywhere. I can't see myself at 10 caring for this movie at all. But I can see myself at 30 maybe warming to it eventually. It's not really a movie for kids, it's a movie that organic, gluten free parents want their kids to like.But if you're trying to find an entry point into Japanimation or are looking for another from its studio/writer, I'd recommend Porco Rosso way before this, even if this one is the more popular.","

"8newk8","24 July 2001","The things which children must cope with are immense and overwhelming.  I think myself lucky to have been safely steered away from such issues as death and loss at an early age, but now that I have seen Tonari no Totoro, I realize that a child's ability to overcome, and the power of the imagination in order to overcome would have helped me through the trauma.Tonari no Totoro deals with such issues when it takes the story of two young sisters, moving to the country with their father as they wait for their mother to recover from some debilitating illness.  But it is not as depressing as it sounds.  In fact, it has to be one of the most uplifting and life affirming movies I have ever seen.  Why?  Because animator Hayao Miyazaki has such an acute understanding of the mindset -- and the imagination -- of children.  Children deal with emotions they can't understand by creating worlds.  By diving into their imagination, they are able to express these emotions in a positive, uplifting way.
And this is how the two sisters of this story deal with the potential loss of their mother.  Projecting their problems through a hole they encounter in the forest, they create an imaginary world of forest beasts which act as playmates and protectors.  And the power of their beliefs then make these creatures real.I gave this video to my niece and nephew before they moved into a new house in a new town.  And although their experience didn't exactly parallel the trauma that the characters in the film experienced, the similarities were sufficient enough so that as soon as they had moved into the new house, and were trying to deal with the unfamiliar surroundings, they had discovered a hole in a hedge, which they subsequently named the ""Totoro hole"", where they could crawl into and find a world all their own, amongst a world they were completely unfamiliar with.  Within weeks, they had introduced all the neighborhood children (their new friends) to the hole, as well as to the film.  Totoro had taken over their new neighborhood!As an adult, you might find yourself sinking into feelings much like this. A sadness for the loss of the ability to tap into our imaginations in order to overcome all obstacles.  But it also will open things up inside you that you thought were long buried over.  Disney could never achieve such a complex mix of emotions.","

I hadn't seen it before (the anime-freaks looked doubtfully at me) and as it is a Studio Ghibli piece, I had quite a good feeling about that this was going to be a good one (as the vast majority of Ghibli's works are so neat). I must say that the story was sweet, and there is some kind of magic woven in here, enhancing the movie in some way, putting a smile on your lips for sure. I can't really point out anything specific that I got really hooked on, but there were something with the atmosphere I believe. A solid 7/10 well worth seeing for the whole family.

"postsenthil","27 October 2019","My Neighbour Totoro, celebrating silver jubilee of its original release this year, is an animated classic directed Hayao Miyazaki. Popularly considered that the best Japanese animated film, it has found global acclaim over the years and remains one of the best animated family entertainers ever made.The story begins with Tatsuo Kusakabe, a university Professor shifting into a rickety rural house with his two daughters - Satsuki & Mei - such that they could stay close to the nursing home where their mother is recovering from an illness. Upon settling into their new home, Mei & Satsuki notice some strange happenings, but are not too perturbed and merely approach them with an innocent curiosity of a child. One fine day, little Mei while playing near the home, comes upon an oversized bunny like creature under a giant camphor tree. She finds the cuddly creature to be a friendly spirit refers to it as Totoro. Eventually, Satsuki also meets the creature after her initial skepticism in what turns out to be a wonderful scene when she waits with an umbrella for her dad to return home from work on a rainy night at a bus stop. The rest of the story follows the encounters between Totoro and the two girls set against the imminent arrival of their mother from the nursing home after her treatment.For most of us who have grown upon a staple of modern digital animated movies churned out by famous Hollywood studios like Pixar or Disney, this is a welcome throwback to those wonderful years of our childhood when we used to be enthralled by animated movies/series such as the Jungle Book, Spiderman, He-Man, etc. Made in the classic style, the colourful creatures and the lush landscapes which are brought to life with great detail and richness in each frame of this movie are an ode to the tireless efforts of the animators who have hand-drawn each frame with oodles of vivid imagination and great passion.This movie treads a path that is markedly different from the several norms of the contemporary animated movies from Hollywood which rarely explore outside a set three act mould of story-telling. There are no superheroes, no fearsome creatures, no bad characters, no life-altering choices or challenges and definitely, no underdog aspiring to ace the masters. This movie, despite having creatures/spirits based on fantasy, portrays a natural flow of life which is close to reality that is unadulterated by the compulsions of creating any onscreen drama.Miyazaki keeps the story line childishly simple and does not bother a great deal on the construction of a plot. Nevertheless, he fleshes out his characters with enough personality to engage the viewer - be it a father who is sensitive, patient, tactful and sensible; or the daughters who are caring, understanding, helpful and responsible; or the mother who is warm and confident despite her ailment. Even the minor characters like the granny and her grandson make an impact on the viewer.The genius of Miyazaki is in the way he seamlessly synthesises the realms of reality with magical charm to present a movie that transports us back to an idyllic world of a joyful childhood filled with innocence, fantasy, mirth and fearless fascination for the unknown. That, in no small measure, explains the overwhelming global success of My Neighbour Totoro which remains an enduring and endearing classic for the whole family to cherish even after two decades of its original release.","

It doesn't always feel as memorable and original as some of Jeunet's previous films but it does boast all of the classic quirks associated with a Jeunet film, including memorable performances from its wonderful cast and some truly beautiful imagery.","

"frankgaipa","7 June 2002","After rewatching this recently on DVD, part of the box set from director Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli, I wanted to buy it for my elderly mother. She'd been enthralled by Princess Mononoke at my place not long before. Since neither she nor my father can handle subtitles, I ordered the best I could find, a dubbed pan-and-scan VHS. What a disaster! But, a disaster with a fine message.Totoro, like every Miyazaki film, is a glorious soundscape. No less than the script and visuals, sounds--her own, verbal and not, and those around her reflected in her every squeak and movement, every sigh, every audible breath--establish the younger child, Mei, as protagonist. Without her unique pass, we have no entrance into the film. This old VHS, besides lopping off so much of the frame that ambient sounds too often make little sense anyway, mutes that part of the soundtrack in favor of vocals, killing nature and Mei along with it as surely as the 'villains' in so many other Ghibli films kill Nature. Mei's words are dubbed, but she's hardly alive here. Untampered with though, this may be Miyazaki's finest and Mei his truest characterization.","

"mbhgkmsgg","1 December 2020","While My Neighbour Totoro isn't as epic or ambitious as Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke, it is probably the most wonderful film that Miyazaki has ever made. It filled me with joy from the beginning to the end and left me feeling happy for hours after. If that doesn't make a movie good, I don't know what does.The thing that I love most about this film is how it always ends with a happy ending. Although there are difficult themes and potentially scary situations, they always tend to end positively. How the film gets to those endings isn't always obvious, but once it gets there, it always made me happy. Obviously, not all films should be like this. Most movies need stakes, and they need to make us feel sad and angry, at times. But sometimes, it's just simply wonderful to sit down and not have to worry about all the bad things that are going to happen. Totoro is probably the perfect example of that kind of film.This film also managed to take me back to my childhood. Something that quite few films have managed to do. Capturing the sense of endless energy and endless excitement even about the smallest things. Those are some of the things that I cherish the most from that time. Mei and Satsuki embody the childhood traits so well, that I noticed myself wishing that I was a kid again. Living care free and doing things that are nothing but fun, is certainly something I miss. This film brought back wonderful memories from many years ago.As mentioned, this film isn't as grand as some of Miyazaki's others. But it doesn't need to be. At its core, it's a very simple film with an even simpler story. It relies on making you feel a certain way, and it does that perfectly. The pure happiness and excitement that I felt while watching My Neighbour Totoro is something that I wont be forgetting any time soon. Had I remembered how wonderful this film makes me feel, I probably wouldn't have waited as long as I did to watch it again.There is really nothing to complain about in this film. There isn't even anything that I'd change. My Neighbour Totoro is one of the best, if not the best, feel good movies ever created. Even in its simplicity it managed to catch the endless imagination of Miyazaki and it brought me into a world of nostalgia, and wonder, and happiness.","

I was suprised. And no, not because I was mistaken. This movie is boring, uninteresting and without a story really. The animation is typical japanese which is also not close to me at all. Everything is a big exaggeration. So I was not wrong with my first judgement but I was suprised how many other people have seen a totaly different film. How is this sweet or cute? When was this funny? When could I have smiled? Never. Not a moment. I loved Howl's castle so this type of cartoon isn't that far from me that it couldn't have touched me if it was good. But no.

"datautisticgamer-74853","26 December 2017","The Music Box Theater not too far away from my house was playing this movie as part of a week long celebration of Studio Ghibli. Being the opportunistic animation watcher that I am, I decided to make today a suitable view for this film, which was on my watchlist. So, what be my thoughts?The animation, as with anything spawned from Studio Ghibli, can only be described with rather bombastically high quality language. While the humans look familiar in style to other Ghibli films (not that it's a fault), Totoro and the other spirits have a design that I really enjoy. It's no wonder that Totoro ended up becoming the Studio Ghibli mascot. The environments are lush, which is a pretty major compliment to pay an animated film from 1988 given how Oliver and Company had really only one OK setting. The story is captivating, although there are some points in the script that I will say weren't done too well in the 2005 dubbing (Mei's cries don't sound like actual 4-year-old cries). The humor, however, blasts full force from both the script and animation, including the infamous Totoro jump scene. I was laughing a lot of the time and a smile remained on my face when the movie ended. As we go for music, it's surprisingly memorable for a movie that isn't a musical; I swear that I could get the main background theme stuck in my head if I watch this one more time. And for characters, I appreciated how Satsuki kept by Mei's side even when their relationship roughened based on their mother, which was a very great message. Most people would probably find Totoro cute (since his merchandise is EVERYWHERE), but I find him more hilarious and fascinating than actually adorable. I don't have much to say for the side characters except that they, like in previous Studio Ghibli movies, succeed in what the script has provided for them.Like almost every film Studio Ghibli has produced, this is a film that I can recommend to any family, otaku, or just the common audience. Just keep the volume down when you watch it, though; some parts of the film nearly slit my eardrums. Children may find Totoro somewhat scary at times, let alone too loud. Regardless, this is a premier family film, and no family deserves to miss it.","

"ccamp89","15 May 2016","Everything is magical when you're a child. A gust of wind over a grassy meadow, a giant conifer reaching to the sky, tadpoles swirling in a puddle, a brand new house to run through and explore. Life is new, exciting, and mysterious.My Neighbor Totoro is a film that perfectly captures the wonder and beauty of life as seen through the eyes of a child. This is Hayao Miyazaki at his most restrained. In the broad scheme of his filmography, it is a distillation of everything that makes his work so effective and beloved: stunningly authentic character animation brimming with personality, gorgeously detailed settings and landscapes, and an ability to capture the magic in the small, inconsequential moments of life. We follow Satsuki and Mei, two young sisters who have moved with their father to a new house in an idyllic rural village. It is soon revealed that the purpose of this move is to be closer to their chronically ill mother who is staying in a nearby hospital - a detail which gains significant weight with the knowledge that Miyazaki's own mother spent a lot of time in the hospital with tuberculosis when he was a child. Although their mother's illness does loom over the film and is a crucial grounding element, it is relatively distant and far from its focal point. Instead, the meat of the film is simply Satuski and Mei exploring their new home and surroundings, assimilating to life in a new town, and, of course, meeting Totoro and friends. Totoro and his companions are the ""spirits of the forest"", as the girls' father puts it. He can't see them, nor can any of the adults in the film. For Mei and Satsuki, though, they are very much alive and real. Totoro acts as a personification of the aforementioned magic of nature and life. He's what makes acorns sprout into trees and propels the wind over the plains. Of course Mei and Satsuki can see him - for them, the wonder and awe of life is still fresh and exhilarating. And even though their father may not physically see these creatures as he works by candle light amidst a mess of papers and books, he seems to remember a time when he did. He nurtures the wonderment that his daughters feel and vicariously experiences it through them, as do we.All Miyzaki films have an environmental theme and display a fond respect for nature; here, it's reverential. Wind rushes over the grassy farmland, butterflies flutter in and out of frame, a snail inches slowly up the stem of a flower, a toad crawls along a dirt road in the middle of a rainstorm, a fish bobs to the surface of a pond setting small ripples in motion which radiate away. Miyazaki hangs over each of these moments and makes it impossible not to experience their simple beauty as the girls do.This is the essence of My Neighbor Totoro. It's a simple, humble, and reflective film free of sensory excess, antagonists, or even a traditional plot. It merely sets out to magnify and bask in the magic of life which becomes all too muted as you age. ""I could see them too, when I was young"", states a warm, elderly neighbor of the girls. With this film, you might yet again.","

"Adele666","13 May 2020","The movie is about 2 sisters who meet a giant creature.It is made by Hayao Miyazaki.The animation is very good, for the 1980s, and is quite fluid.The characters are very likeable and you get emotionally attached to them.The sub is better.I would definitely recommend this to people interested in Anime.","

"Reverie5","19 June 2013","Definitely liked this one, especially Mei, such an adorable bundle of joy (reminds me of my niece). I'm on a mission to watch all of Miyazaki's works, and he has yet to disappoint. So far I've seen Spirited Away and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (skipped Castle in the Sky, that will be next). Definitely not my average film where I have to think about all the themes in the movie. I'm always having to look them up because I don't actively analyze what each character/scene represents. I enjoy how Miyazaki makes me think about what each film of his represents.I watched it with English dub (starring the Fanning sisters) and it was superb. They really made their characters to life. Enjoyed hearing Superman's voice as well (Tim Daly as Tatsuo). Was a little upset at first because I wanted to watch it in the original Japanese dub, but I watched it with my sister and she doesn't do subtitles. Time to watch it again.","

"chribren","31 March 2014","""Tonari no Totoro"", also called ""My Neighbor Totoro"" in English, is a family-oriented anime feature made in 1988 by Hayao Miyazaki and his own-founded company Studio Ghibli.Basic plot: When Satsuki and her little sister Mei move into a country house together with their father (so they get to be closer to their sick mother who's in a hospital), they get to be friends with various creatures and a forest keeper called Totoro. So the sisters get to experience a great adventure together.For several years ago, I first saw this on a Norwegian DVD I rented at the library where I'm working. And this made me want to watch more movies made by director Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, including ""Howl's Moving Castle"", ""Spirited Away"" and ""Ponyo"".When I first saw this flick, I found the animation and the drawings to be wonderful, and the story to be pretty good for an animated feature made for the general audience. To be more right, I just enjoy the animation style Studio Ghibli is giving us the audience. This studio just seems to know how to put elements like humor, suspense and dramatic into their works, and how to make a good family-friendly story as ""Totoro"" has.For the content itself, the most comical scene all together has to be the rainy scene where Satsuki offers Totoro her umbrella, and Totoro seems to get delighted by the raindrops falling on the umbrella.It is also interesting to see that the film's titular character Totoro is also used as the mascot for the company itself, hence this character being a part of the Studio Ghibli logo.The Malay box set called ""Studio Ghibli Movies Collection"", which I have as bought through eBay, includes 17 nicely done animated movies and a concert special, with ""My Neighbor Totoro"" as one of them.At the end, I recommend this for any family around the world. Because of this being one of the greatest Ghibli masterpieces I've seen, I give this a full rating of 10/10.",NA
"hayashimegumi","28 July 2014","Honestly, I am a little constrained to review this film as it is the trademark film of Studio Ghibli. This film is constantly regarded as one of the best animated film in the world and the company even have Totoro as its company logo. There is so much love for this film and it certainly has large following.However, I will review equally as usual and I hope I won't be misunderstood in any way - I love this film.My Neighbor Totoro (1988) is a lovely film. It is imaginative yet so realistic in a way so original that its naivety and novelty still captivates its audiences to date although decades has passed. It preaches us to believe and respect the nature and spiritual world. It is charming.Aside from being light-hearted most of the time, this film is also comical. I certainly smiled at several points of the film while they adapt country side life because the characters are adorable and I absolutely loved the yōkais created by the director especially Totoro and Susuwatari. You have no idea how much I loved supernatural and mythical creatures, fictional or not ♥On the other hand, if I am to choose the best 1980s animated feature film from Studio Ghibli, I would certainly go for the lesser known film Grave of the Fireflies (1988) though. This is because of its powerful impact and I also liked Setsuko more than Mei. Spare me, Totoro's fans. *土下座*Nonetheless, if you have not watch this film, you should and you will also be able to find out why My Neighbor Totoro (1988) has charmed thousands of fans worldwide!",NA
"christiam-51976","3 September 2022","This movie is pretty great. Dont expect to be entertained in this movie though because it mostly does not have a plot which can be both good and bad. The movie is made of multiple really cute moments and also the small little moments with family that make you smile and make you giggle. Maybe if you're an adult you wont like this movie due to the fact that it can be a little bit boring at times. Although if you simply watch without judgement and just watch for enjoyment purposes without trying to see if it's good or not i know you will enjoy this movie. Definitely gonna show this one to my kids.",NA
"pcantrell","7 October 2003","This is one of the most beautifully crafted movies I know of.  It's mostly cute and heartwarming -- funny forest spirits, kids, the Japanese countryside, happy family -- but underlying that are fears far more real and frightening than any bad guy Disney ever concocted: the ill mother, the endangered child.  The main characters are two of the most believable kids I know of in cinema, and we see the world through their eyes: not only the magical worlds of imagination and nature, but also the presence of death and the fragility of happiness.  Don't get me wrong -- it's a very, very happy movie -- but in spite of the wildly imaginative fantasy element, it's a believable happiness because of the other things it acknowledges.  I don't know of another movie than manages to be so incredibly cute and kid-friendly and without compromising an ounce of artistic integrity.NOTE: I highly recommend AGAINST the dubbed version.  The children in English are whinier and more stereotypical Hollywood kids; they lose some of the intelligence and depth that makes the kids so wonderful in Japanese.  In some movies as visual as this one, the dub is preferable since it lets you focus on those visuals ... but not this one.",NA

"biz`","11 January 2000","in the end i was disappointed. too much focus on satsuke and mei running around the countryside and not enough focus on the relationship between totoro and the girls.but visually, my neighbour totoro is stunning. the style of the characters is pure miyazaki and it was nice to look at.but the story lacked any sort of real cohesiveness. this movie could have been made just as easily without totoro, with a focus on the effect the mother's extended illness has on her two children. on the other hand, this would have been a much better movie if the focus was on the girl's adventures with totoro and his friends inside the giant camphor tree and around the countryside.worth a look either way.",NA
"danjakubik","15 March 2010","""My Neighbor Totoro""Animated, 1988, JapanRunning time: 88 minutes Written and directed by: Hiyao Miyazaki* * * 1/2 Very GoodI happened to see this film March 13, 2010, for the very first time and have many positive adjectives of praise for this film fresh in mind. My first impressions are: ""My Neighbor Totoro"" is an exceptionally imaginative, detailed, charming, heartwarming and very cute film. Japan has mastered cute probably better than anyone else in the world. Cute is relatively easy to achieve, especially in an animated film, as the legacy of Disney shows. So, cute, really is a weak adjective of praise here.""My Neighbor Totoro"", 1988, is the first feature length animated film from the acclaimed animation director Hayao Miyazaki of Japan. Prior to this film, he worked in television, but found that artistically unsatisfying over time. Miyazaki has said, at first, he did not consider animation, as the medium of choice, for his imaginative stories and career change. For anyone with a large and vivid imagination, animation is the ideal choice of expression. If one can imagine it, one can bring it to life in animation, without difficulty or great expense, as compared to live action film.What most impressed me about this film is Miyazaki's keen knowledge and expression of how it feels to be a child, how we perceive and react to the world around us, with energy, excitement, enthusiasm, imagination and curiosity. To me, this is what came across, most profoundly. Animation and sound are good overall in the film, nothing especially impressive. This is to be expected, as a first time feature length film director rarely is granted a large budget for their very first film. What's impressive about ""My Neighbor Totoro"", is the storytelling. That's what matters most, of course. Film is simply a highly visual medium of storytelling.Miyazaki based the story of the film on his own childhood, growing up in rural Japan during the 1950's. All of the locations in the animated film, have their real life counterparts in Japan. The story concerns two young girls and their father, who move into a new countryside home, while their mother is away, sick in a hospital. Totoro can best be described as a large, gentle, friendly, furry, teddy bear-cat kind of creature, who is actually a spirit of the forest, near the new home of the two girls. Miyazaki is wise to hold off and wait until the halfway point of the story, to introduce the main character of Totoro, to build up the anticipation of Totoro's arrival in the film. The cat bus is an especially charming and imaginative character that appears later in the film. Miyazki's story telling style keeps some suspense going, regarding the mother's relation to the story.Miyzaki's film takes it's time to slowly introduce it's characters and become acquainted with them. Clearly, Miyazaki is a gifted storyteller, with heart and details in his characters and stories. What people appreciate most about his animated films is that they are about ordinary, common people in extraordinary situations and told with heart, charm, genuine emotion and special little details, regarding the characters, landscapes and inventions. When first released theatrically in Japan, ""My Neighbor Totoro"" was only modestly successful. When it was later released on television in Japan, it took off in popularity.I have seen a number of Miyazaki films since his ""Princess Mononoke"", 1997, before seeing ""My Neighbor Totoro"", his very first film. ""My Neighbor Totoro"" by itself, is enough to have made me a Miyazaki fan, if I had seen it years ago, before I ever saw any of his other animated films.Miyazaki's animated films are the type that always present something new both in characters and inventions, in an engaging and captivating way. With most of his animated films, it always worth experiencing them again and they continue to delight and entertain, both children and adults alike.I consider myself a child at heart. I remember how it felt to be a child. How the world seemed so different at that time in life.. Children perceive and react to the world much differently than adults. Viewing a film such as ""My Neighbor Totoro"", Miyazaki recaptures childhood very accurately. Doesn't really matter he is Japanese. Children are children, with the same traits, all over the world, regardless of country or culture.To me, Miyazaki deserves comparison to the great animation pioneer, Walt Disney. I realize this is a big compliment, however I feel that Miyazaki has earned and deserves comparison to Disney. Like Disney, Miyazaki is also highly imaginative, artistic and detailed with his animation stories, as was Walt Disney. I consider Miyazaki, the new Disney. Miyazaki is an excellent story teller and deserves his exalted and admired status within the animation industry, here in the United States.",NA
"ian_farley","19 April 2023","I hate this movie, as it is one of the few movies where I felt like my time was wasted, in a way that made me feel sad I'll never get it back. This movie is dumb, and has no plot at all. I got to write that this review contains no spoilers, because there is nothing to spoil. This movie just has characters who exist, and do absolutely nothing for 90 minutes. And the theme song is obnoxiously catchy. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I regret watching it. The ""conflict"" at the end of the movie is resolved by the most contrived Deus ex Machina I have ever seen, and leaves the viewer unsatisfied. Words cannot describe how much I hate this stupid, stupid movie. Anyone who watches it will become significantly dumber after watching it.",NA
"g-87877","28 March 2020","The disappearing countryside scenery, the kind grandparents, the childhood playmates laughing and chasing, the carefree life, is the most innocent and beautiful memories of childhood.Hayao miyazaki is a genius with a soft heart.

"dyann60","16 June 2010","This was both of my children's favorite movie as kids! So I thought I would surprise my 20 year old with the new Disney version for his birthday. Big mistake! They re-did everything. They performed the notorious Disney cutting of the film they're famous for when given foreign animated films. Eliminating scenes all throughout the movie, or just cutting scenes shorter. All the voices were redone horribly. The two young girls who were tasked to re-perform the voices of the two main characters sucked. Every change was pointless and brought the movie down. The original American version of the film done by Fox, I would rate it a 10/10 as a movie your children can enjoy and love. The new ""remastered"" Disney special edition I would give a 5/10. They really did that much damage.I sold the new version and went on ebay and bought the original. If you haven't seen this movie before, please buy the original! Disney really blew it this time.",NA

"shivamt25","6 April 2016","My neighbor Totoro is an incredible film. Its about two sisters, who have this awesome dad and a sick but loving mother and how these two sometimes float into this mythical world where various nature spirits exit. One of the things i noticed was that the creators have given crucial amount of time to make the movie detailed. Like when one of the sisters trip and fell, they have dirt on their knees when they rise, like how strikingly similar features these sisters have like their parents. Watching this film, i had a smile on my face all the time. It has a calming effect which make you look away from all the tension in the world and just enjoy the adventures those girls are facing.I think it is an amazing and a must watch movie for kids.",NA
"kengoogloo","18 July 2005","Many movies are somehow based on the classic conflict of Good vs Evil, even for 'innocent' movies like 'Finding Nemo', one of the main theme is to save Nemo from some bad guys.But in this movie, forget about the mad world and immense yourself in a small Japanese village, through the eyes of two kids. It is about their exploration with the surrounding and how they build bonds with the nature. This movie brings back the feeling of child-like curiosity, and one can spend days in playing with the flowers and other animals.And perhaps this is how children look at the world, always fun and curious. Now for the adults we somehow see the world as more black and white, good and bad, right and wrong. And I'm not sure who has a better perception about the reality :-)",NA
"Wistfull","1 January 2023","This is an endlessly rewatchable film. Every year or two I get the same feeling: ""should I watch Totoro again?"" And every time it fills me with a warm, serene joy.This is not a plot-driven thrill ride - it's scenes from a life as experienced by children. The feeling that comes accross is that of childhood, with its excitement and troubles. Endless days filled with pointless little things that feel oh-so-important, and every now and then a big thing that causes even bigger feelings.And feelings seem to be the point of the film. It's not about story or character development, but getting to feel things alongside the characters. The sigh of contentment that Mei has over her perfect little lunchbox, the shriek of joy when she sees the first totoro, the soft calm of napping in the underground lair.The real gift this film has given to its viewers is that little burst of joy they now feel every time raindrops drum their umbrellas. What better legacy for a film!",NA

"jameslinton-75252","4 May 2016","My Neighbour Totoro is another wonderful effort by Studio Ghibli. It is a brilliant examination of childhood exploration and leaves you longing for simpler days. The animations were great and Totoro and the Catbus were great creations. They were absolutely adorable. I would love a life-size Totoro cushion or Totoro onesie. The music in my Neighbour Totoro was also great. I was just a little sad that this film was as short as it was. Totoro is such a great character that it would have been nice to learn more about him.

Highly recommended.Any of Miyazaki's other works are also worth checking out: Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, etc.I think the reason I'm so drawn to Studio Ghibli's films is because Disney has created the ""fomula animated feature"" and polished it until I became utterly bored and cynical.
